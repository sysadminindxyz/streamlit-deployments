Residents have seen their day-to-day lives reshaped, and local small-business owners are no exception.\n[3]: Along key immigrant business corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul, roughly 80 % of immigrant-owned businesses closed in a single week, with many reporting sales down 50\u2013100 %. Greater Minnesota impacts: Restaurants in Rochester have limited operations or closed due to staffing shortages and fear, while Somali-owned businesses in St. Cloud saw significant declines in foot traffic following confrontations with ICE agents.\n[4]: As they made their way to the city's NBA arena to hold an anti-ICE rally, taking place on the home court of the Minnesota Timberwolves, protesters chanted and played music. On Friday morning, Minneapolis resident Corey Lahm closed his business, Harriet Grove Botanicals, in solidarity and headed to a protest. He objected to the presence of ICE agents in his city, and was outraged by Good's death in early January.\n[5]: At a gathering of the Uptown Association Saturday, Mayor Jacob Frey had some sobering numbers on the impact of the ICE presence.\n[6]: Learn about the impact of current federal actions and how the City of Minneapolis is responding.\n[7]: FOX 9's Corin Hoggard joined All Day on Monday afternoon as several Twin Cities restaurants are closed due to ongoing safety concerns with an increased presence of federal agents.

An estimated 76,000 people were in need of rental or food assistance to the tune of about $25 million, and city expenses to respond to ICE\u2019s presence in Minneapolis totaled $6 million.\n[10]: A customer browses baked goods at Panaderia San Miguel in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Also listed are local mutual aid organizations offering home delivery. All three locations of Colonial Market\u2014in Minneapolis, North Minneapolis, and Bloomington\u2014are offering home delivery.\n[14]: The resulting turmoil of Operation Metro Surge has left its mark on businesses and events across the state and in Minneapolis in particular. According to Meet Minneapolis, a January survey sent to its partners found 80% of respondents have experienced canceled, postponed or reduced bookings or sales in the wake of the ICE surge.\n[15]: Ramlo Botan, who helps to run the restaurant, said not just businesses, but the entire local community has fought growing financial struggles since immigration officers overwhelmed the neighborhood. \u201cEveryone has to pay their rent, pay their utility bill, their car payments, credit card payments,\u201d Ramlo said. \u201cIf people can\u2019t work, how are they going to pay their bills?\u201d \u00b7 Gonzalez echoed the sentiment. The Latino community has great economic power in South Minneapolis, but with ICE activity driving members to stay home, there is very little support left for local businesses.\n[16]: In turn, hundreds of Minnesota businesses closed on Friday as part of a general strike to protest ICE. Logan expects the economic impact from Friday alone to be in the millions, adding that the aftermath of ICE\u2019s presence could cost businesses tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming weeks and months.\n[17]: ICE\u2019s increased presence and forceful arrests at businesses has sparked public outcry, some of it directed at the companies themselves for not taking a strong enough stand. Some employers, particularly smaller business owners, are speaking out about ICE\u2019s impacts on their workers and customers. But a handful of bigger corporations have stayed largely silent, at least publicly, about enforcement making its way to their storefronts.

Increased immigration enforcement has led to a decrease in customers as fear keeps residents from leaving their homes. This has resulted in many businesses along Central Avenue in Minneapolis closing or experiencing very limited activity, with some expressing concerns about making rent and considering options for the future .\nThe \"Operation Metro Surge\" initiated by the U.S. federal government brought thousands of ICE agents into Minneapolis, which further escalated tensions between law enforcement and protesters after two Americans were killed by ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents in January . As a result, the economic consequences have been severe, with approximately 80% of immigrant-owned businesses closing in a single week along key immigrant business corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul, and many reporting sales down 50-100% .\nThe impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis has not only affected business owners but also employees and customers, with employees cutting hours and entire communities feeling the ripple effects of the ICE crackdown .

For example, the Latino community in South Minneapolis, which holds great economic power, has seen a sharp decline in revenue for local businesses due to ICE activity driving community members to stay home. Business owners in the area have reported revenue falling by more than half over the past several weeks . Additionally, the Minneapolis City Council calculated that immigration raids and operations in the area have resulted in nearly $200 million in losses for local businesses, particularly impacting restaurants, supermarkets, laundries, and workshops run by Latino immigrants .\nFurthermore, the fear of ICE raids has led to a decrease in customer traffic and revenue for businesses. Many businesses have had to close temporarily, with some even participating in a day of \"no work, no school, no shopping\" to protest against ICE operations . The impact on employee morale and attendance has also been notable, as legal citizens are afraid to come to work due to indiscriminate ICE raids .\nOverall, the heightened immigration enforcement by ICE in Minneapolis, particularly through initiatives like \"Operation Metro Surge,\" has caused significant disruptions to local businesses, workers, and the economy.

One incident involved ICE agents visiting stores, leading Caribou Coffee to send a memo to managers outlining how to respond if ICE agents were to visit. In addition, there were reports of managers being told they could not refuse service to ICE agents, even if they feared for their safety.

There have been concerns raised by employees about how to respond if ICE officers arrive at their worksites and calls for clearer guidance from employers on how to handle such situations. The pressures have been particularly acute at Target, a major employer in the area, after the detention of two workers inside one of its stores.\nFurthermore, there have been reports of ICE raids and increased enforcement efforts in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area, with Operation Metro Surge announced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This has led to heightened fear and anxiety among employees at businesses, such as Holy Land, where immigrant workers from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America are worried about potential detentions.\nThe fear of ICE raids has also had a noticeable impact on the local business environment, with reports of decreased traffic at places like the Midtown Global Market due to the apprehension surrounding immigration enforcement operations.

With Minnesota's largest employers, including Caribou Coffee, feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers following a tragic event, such as the killing of Renee Good, it is clear that these actions have influenced daily operations and employee relations at Caribou Coffee. There have been instances of backlash and customer concern regarding the company's ICE policies, as evidenced by a customer backlash initiated against Caribou Coffee over these policies. This highlights the potential negative repercussions that can arise from the implementation of certain strategies in response to external factors like ICE presence.\nDespite these challenges, Caribou Coffee maintains a strong digital presence and a diverse product portfolio aimed at enhancing customer experience.

The increased ICE activity has led to a decline in customers for businesses, with some reporting seeing as few as three to four people a day compared to the previous average of 30 to 50 customers . This decrease in foot traffic has resulted in substantial revenue losses, with an estimated $81 million in lost revenue for restaurants and small businesses across the city in just one month .\nImmigrant-owned businesses have been particularly hard hit by ICE operations, with roughly 80% of immigrant-owned businesses along key corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul closing in a single week, and many reporting sales down by 50-100% . The impact extends beyond just financial losses, as businesses are also facing challenges such as limited operations, staffing shortages, and fear of further confrontations with ICE agents . Additionally, the entire local community is experiencing financial struggles due to the overwhelming presence of immigration officers, leading to concerns about how residents will be able to pay their bills and support local businesses .\nThe broader impact of ICE operations on local economies and communities is evident in the $81 million in lost revenue for small businesses, $47 million in lost wages for residents who are afraid to leave their homes, and $38 million in unrealized construction value . The economic strain caused by ICE's presence is estimated to be between $10 million to $20 million in lost revenue per week for businesses in Minneapolis, with some reporting an 80% revenue decline year-over-year in the past two months .\nOverall, the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has reshaped the day-to-day lives of residents and business owners alike, with significant financial losses and community disruptions being felt across the city . The impact of increased immigration enforcement is not only keeping residents at home but also hurting neighborhood economies, affecting not only business owners but also employees and customers .

Minnesota's largest employers, such as Caribou Coffee, are feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers in the state following the killing of Renee Good. In fact, ICE agents detained a contractor at General Mills in Chanhassen, which is a significant employer in the state. This demonstrates the tangible effects of ICE presence on businesses in the area .\nCaribou Coffee, with locations in Minneapolis, has faced challenges amidst the heightened ICE presence in the state. Despite being owned by JAB Holding Co., a private equity firm that also owns other brands like Panera and Einstein Bros. Bagels, Caribou Coffee continues to operate independently with its own brand, management team, and growth strategy, remaining based in Minneapolis . This shows that despite being part of a larger conglomerate, the local identity and operations of Caribou Coffee in Minneapolis are maintained.\nIn terms of customer feedback, some patrons have mentioned issues with order accuracy and high sugar content in Caribou Coffee drinks. It seems that there have been instances where orders have been incorrect, which may impact customer satisfaction and retention . However, Caribou Coffee continues to offer a variety of handcrafted beverages, including mochas and signature drinks like the Berry White Mocha Cooler and the Turtle Mocha, to appeal to a wide range of tastes .\nOverall, while the specific impact of ICE presence on Caribou Coffee and other local businesses may vary, the broader context of heightened enforcement activities in Minneapolis can contribute to challenges faced by businesses in the area. The unique position of Caribou Coffee as a local establishment within a larger corporate structure adds another layer of complexity to how it navigates these challenges in the face of changing immigration enforcement dynamics in the region.\nWikipedia Writer: What specific actions or strategies has Caribou Coffee implemented in response to the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN, and how have these efforts impacted the business operations and customer experience?\nExpert: Caribou Coffee has implemented specific strategies in response to the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN. According to a TikTok video and Reddit post, Caribou Coffee allegedly instructed its employees not to refuse service to ICE agents, even if they feel personally unsafe. The company also provided talking points for managers on how to respond to customers inquiring about ICE presence. Furthermore, a memo was sent to Caribou Coffee managers outlining how they should respond if ICE agents visit stores. This indicates that Caribou Coffee has established guidelines and protocols for handling interactions with ICE within their establishments.\nThe impact of these efforts on business operations and customer experience is notable. With Minnesota's largest employers, including Caribou Coffee, feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers following a tragic event, such as the killing of Renee Good, it is clear that these actions have influenced daily operations and employee relations at Caribou Coffee. There have been instances of backlash and customer concern regarding the company's ICE policies, as evidenced by a customer backlash initiated against Caribou Coffee over these policies. This highlights the potential negative repercussions that can arise from the implementation of certain strategies in response to external factors like ICE presence.\nDespite these challenges, Caribou Coffee maintains a strong digital presence and a diverse product portfolio aimed at enhancing customer experience. The company has also utilized new reviews during the pandemic to analyze client feedback and adjust protocols effectively, maintaining an average star rating throughout this challenging period. Caribou Coffee's strategic marketing efforts, including expansion and distribution channels, have contributed to its success in the competitive coffee industry and its ability to reach a broader customer base.\nIn conclusion, Caribou Coffee's response to the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has included specific actions and strategies aimed at addressing employee safety and customer interactions. While these efforts have had implications on business operations and customer experience, the company continues to prioritize digital engagement, product quality, and strategic marketing to navigate challenges and maintain its position in the market.\nWikipedia Writer: How has Caribou Coffee's response to the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis impacted employee relations and internal policies, considering the instructions provided to employees regarding interactions with ICE agents and the establishment of protocols for handling such situations?\nExpert: Based on the information gathered, Caribou Coffee's response to the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has had implications for employee relations and internal policies. According to a TikTok video, Caribou allegedly instructed its employees not to refuse service to ICE agents, even if they feel personally unsafe. Managers were given talking points on how to respond to customers asking about ICE presence, stating that ICE agents should be served like any other guest.\nIn light of ICE operations spreading around the country, coffee businesses and their workers, including Caribou Coffee, are increasingly feeling the effects. In Minnesota, where much of the current ICE presence is focused, brands like Starbucks and Caribou Coffee have come under fire. ICE agents have conducted raids on coffee farms in Hawaii, and cafe workers, as well as coffee shop owners, have been detained.\nFurthermore, there is a legal distinction between public and private areas of businesses, and employees may not always be aware of this. ICE officers require a judge-signed warrant to enter private areas, which is crucial for employees to understand.\nIt is evident that Caribou Coffee's response to the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has raised concerns among employees and the public. Some individuals have criticized the company for not allowing employees to refuse service to ICE agents, while others have commended the policy as a way to ensure the safety of employees. The impact of these instructions on employee relations and internal policies at Caribou Coffee is a topic of ongoing discussion and debate in the community.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide any insights on how the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has impacted the operations and customer behavior at local businesses like Caribou Coffee?\nExpert: Based on the information gathered, the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has had a significant impact on local businesses like Caribou Coffee. Increased immigration enforcement has led to a decrease in customers as fear keeps residents from leaving their homes. This has resulted in many businesses along Central Avenue in Minneapolis closing or experiencing very limited activity, with some expressing concerns about making rent and considering options for the future .\nThe \"Operation Metro Surge\" initiated by the U.S. federal government brought thousands of ICE agents into Minneapolis, which further escalated tensions between law enforcement and protesters after two Americans were killed by ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents in January . As a result, the economic consequences have been severe, with approximately 80% of immigrant-owned businesses closing in a single week along key immigrant business corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul, and many reporting sales down 50-100% .\nThe impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis has not only affected business owners but also employees and customers, with employees cutting hours and entire communities feeling the ripple effects of the ICE crackdown . A report compiled by city staff detailed $81 million in lost revenue for small businesses, $47 million in lost wages for people who were afraid to leave home, and $4.7 million in hotel cancellations extending through the summer, highlighting the extensive economic repercussions of ICE's presence .\nFurthermore, businesses like Panaderia San Miguel in Minneapolis had to close for three weeks due to federal activity in the area, reflecting the challenges faced by small businesses across the Twin Cities as a result of the heightened immigration enforcement . In response to the turmoil caused by Operation Metro Surge, hundreds of Minnesota businesses participated in a general strike to protest ICE, with the economic impact from a single day of strike expected to be in the millions, potentially costing businesses tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming weeks and months .\nOverall, the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has not only reshaped the day-to-day lives of residents but has also had a profound impact on local businesses, employees, and communities, leading to financial struggles and economic uncertainties for many in the area .\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide any specific information or examples on how the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has directly impacted businesses like Caribou Coffee in terms of sales, customer behavior, and overall operations?\nExpert: The presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has had a significant impact on local businesses, including Caribou Coffee, in terms of sales, customer behavior, and overall operations. For example, the Latino community in South Minneapolis, which holds great economic power, has seen a sharp decline in revenue for local businesses due to ICE activity driving community members to stay home. Business owners in the area have reported revenue falling by more than half over the past several weeks . Additionally, the Minneapolis City Council calculated that immigration raids and operations in the area have resulted in nearly $200 million in losses for local businesses, particularly impacting restaurants, supermarkets, laundries, and workshops run by Latino immigrants .\nFurthermore, the fear of ICE raids has led to a decrease in customer traffic and revenue for businesses. Many businesses have had to close temporarily, with some even participating in a day of \"no work, no school, no shopping\" to protest against ICE operations . The impact on employee morale and attendance has also been notable, as legal citizens are afraid to come to work due to indiscriminate ICE raids .\nOverall, the heightened immigration enforcement by ICE in Minneapolis, particularly through initiatives like \"Operation Metro Surge,\" has caused significant disruptions to local businesses, workers, and the economy. The federal invasion of the Twin Cities has led to businesses being forced to close, while also consuming significant resources of local law enforcement . This has created an environment of fear and uncertainty for business owners, employees, and customers alike, ultimately affecting the sales, operations, and overall viability of businesses like Caribou Coffee in the Minneapolis area.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide any data or statistics on the specific impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis on Caribou Coffee, such as changes in sales revenue, customer traffic, and operational challenges faced by the business?\nExpert: Based on the information available, there is no specific data or statistics directly linking the impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis on Caribou Coffee. However, it is important to note that Caribou Coffee is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and has a significant presence in the area, with approximately 473 coffeehouses in operation, including 41 franchised locations. The company's success in Minnesota, where approximately half of its coffeehouses and net sales are located, has been noted as being more profitable than its locations outside of the state. This suggests that the local market conditions, consumer preferences, and competitive landscape in Minneapolis play a significant role in Caribou Coffee's overall performance.\nAdditionally, Caribou Coffee's annual revenue has been reported to be over $500 million, indicating a substantial financial presence in the market. The company has also expanded its distribution channels beyond its coffeehouses to include grocery stores, mass retailers, club stores, and online platforms, which may help mitigate any potential challenges faced by individual locations due to external factors such as ICE presence in the area.\nIt is worth mentioning that Caribou Coffee was taken private in a $340 million deal by German equity company JAB Holding Company in December 2012, with the commitment to continue operating as an independent company with its own brand, management team, and growth strategy, remaining based in Minneapolis. This suggests a level of stability and resilience in the face of external market influences.\nIn conclusion, while specific data on the impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis on Caribou Coffee may not be available, the company's strong financial performance, strategic distribution channels, and commitment to its local presence in Minneapolis indicate a level of adaptability and success in navigating various market challenges.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide any specific examples or incidents where ICE presence in Minneapolis has affected local businesses, such as Caribou Coffee?\nExpert: The presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has had a notable impact on local businesses, including Caribou Coffee. One incident involved ICE agents visiting stores, leading Caribou Coffee to send a memo to managers outlining how to respond if ICE agents were to visit. In addition, there were reports of managers being told they could not refuse service to ICE agents, even if they feared for their safety. This caused concern among employees and customers, as seen in Twitter complaints about Caribou Coffee locations being closed unexpectedly.\nFurthermore, large employers in Minnesota, including Caribou Coffee, have been feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers in the state following the killing of Renee Good. This pressure has led to businesses like Caribou Coffee being inadvertently drawn into the resistance against ICE enforcement in the community. Additionally, local businesses, including mom-and-pop restaurants in south Minneapolis, have displayed signs saying \"No ICE\" to show solidarity with those affected by ICE actions in the area.\nIt is evident that the increased presence of ICE in Minneapolis has created a challenging environment for businesses, with some reporting significant decreases in revenue due to customers feeling uncomfortable patronizing establishments in the midst of heightened immigration enforcement. In response to the federal actions and tensions caused by ICE, many small businesses in Minnesota are resisting ICE enforcement and actively supporting their workers and neighbors rather than simply shutting down.\nOverall, the impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis has had ripple effects on businesses like Caribou Coffee, prompting managers to navigate how to respond to ICE agents, causing concerns among employees and customers, and leading to a broader community response against ICE enforcement in the area.\nWikipedia Writer: How have employees at Caribou Coffee and other local businesses in Minneapolis been directly impacted by the presence of ICE agents, in terms of job security, work environment, and relationships with coworkers and customers?\nExpert: Employees at Caribou Coffee and other local businesses in Minneapolis have been directly impacted by the presence of ICE agents in various ways. There have been concerns raised by employees about how to respond if ICE officers arrive at their worksites and calls for clearer guidance from employers on how to handle such situations. The pressures have been particularly acute at Target, a major employer in the area, after the detention of two workers inside one of its stores.\nFurthermore, there have been reports of ICE raids and increased enforcement efforts in the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul area, with Operation Metro Surge announced by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This has led to heightened fear and anxiety among employees at businesses, such as Holy Land, where immigrant workers from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America are worried about potential detentions.\nThe fear of ICE raids has also had a noticeable impact on the local business environment, with reports of decreased traffic at places like the Midtown Global Market due to the apprehension surrounding immigration enforcement operations. The presence of ICE agents has also sparked protests in Minneapolis, with demonstrators clashing with federal law enforcement outside a federal building.\nSome business owners, like Corey Lahm of Harriet Grove Botanicals, have expressed solidarity with protesters and closed their businesses in objection to the ICE presence in the city. Lahm saw the immigration raids as an economic threat to his business and others in his community.\nThere have been criticisms of large corporations in Minneapolis for their perceived lack of vocal response to the effects of immigration enforcement in the city, compared to smaller local businesses that have displayed signs stating \"No ICE.\" The actions of ICE agents have prompted protests in the streets, with thousands rallying against immigration enforcement following incidents like the killing of Renee Good by ICE agents.\nOverall, the presence of ICE agents in Minneapolis has created a climate of fear and uncertainty for employees at Caribou Coffee and other local businesses, impacting job security, work environments, and relationships with coworkers and customers.\nWikipedia Writer: How have businesses like Caribou Coffee in Minneapolis adapted their operations or policies in response to the presence of ICE agents and the challenges they bring to the community?\nExpert: Businesses in Minneapolis, such as Caribou Coffee, have had to adapt their operations and policies in response to the presence of ICE agents and the challenges they bring to the community. In light of the heightened tensions and increased ICE activity in the area, local shops have been supporting the community by considering whether to close on specific days as a form of protest against ICE operations . Additionally, some grocery stores in the metro area are offering free food delivery to those impacted by ICE activity, while mutual aid organizations are providing home delivery services .\nThe federal government's increased presence in Minneapolis has led to significant disruptions in the lives of residents and local small-business owners . Many businesses have been less outspoken about President Trump's policies out of fear of retaliation or boycotts, as seen with a Hilton-owned Hampton Inn cancelling bookings for ICE members in early January . The surge of federal agents in the area has prompted businesses to reassess their strategies moving forward .\nThe economic strain facing local businesses and workers as a result of ICE operations has largely been ignored by Minnesota Republican lawmakers, who have defended ICE operations without acknowledging the harm to the state's economy and key industries . As a response to the economic crisis caused by the ICE surge, the Minneapolis Foundation has activated funds to support small businesses, including grants for immigrant-owned businesses .\nThe impact of ICE operations on businesses has been severe, with many establishments closing or experiencing limited activity, leading to concerns about rent payments and the future viability of these businesses . City leaders have reported that local businesses are losing millions of dollars per week, with emergency room and clinic visits in the area down by 25 percent . The killing of individuals by ICE agents has further exacerbated tensions and brought condemnation from local officials and community organizations .\nIn conclusion, businesses in Minneapolis, including Caribou Coffee, have had to navigate the challenges brought about by the presence of ICE agents in the community. From closures in solidarity with protests against ICE operations to economic strains on local businesses, the impact of ICE activities on businesses in Minneapolis has been significant and multifaceted. It is crucial for businesses to find ways to adapt and support the community during these challenging times.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide details on any specific incidents involving ICE presence in Minneapolis, particularly any interactions with local businesses such as Caribou Coffee?\nExpert: Based on the gathered information, there have been several incidents involving ICE presence in Minneapolis that have impacted local businesses and the community.

Minnesota's largest employers, such as Caribou Coffee, are feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers in the state following the killing of Renee Good. In fact, ICE agents detained a contractor at General Mills in Chanhassen, which is a significant employer in the state. This demonstrates the tangible effects of ICE presence on businesses in the area .\nCaribou Coffee, with locations in Minneapolis, has faced challenges amidst the heightened ICE presence in the state. Despite being owned by JAB Holding Co., a private equity firm that also owns other brands like Panera and Einstein Bros. Bagels, Caribou Coffee continues to operate independently with its own brand, management team, and growth strategy, remaining based in Minneapolis . This shows that despite being part of a larger conglomerate, the local identity and operations of Caribou Coffee in Minneapolis are maintained.\nIn terms of customer feedback, some patrons have mentioned issues with order accuracy and high sugar content in Caribou Coffee drinks. It seems that there have been instances where orders have been incorrect, which may impact customer satisfaction and retention . However, Caribou Coffee continues to offer a variety of handcrafted beverages, including mochas and signature drinks like the Berry White Mocha Cooler and the Turtle Mocha, to appeal to a wide range of tastes .\nOverall, while the specific impact of ICE presence on Caribou Coffee and other local businesses may vary, the broader context of heightened enforcement activities in Minneapolis can contribute to challenges faced by businesses in the area. The unique position of Caribou Coffee as a local establishment within a larger corporate structure adds another layer of complexity to how it navigates these challenges in the face of changing immigration enforcement dynamics in the region.\nWikipedia Writer: What specific actions or strategies has Caribou Coffee implemented in response to the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN, and how have these efforts impacted the business operations and customer experience?\nExpert: Caribou Coffee has implemented specific strategies in response to the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN. According to a TikTok video and Reddit post, Caribou Coffee allegedly instructed its employees not to refuse service to ICE agents, even if they feel personally unsafe. The company also provided talking points for managers on how to respond to customers inquiring about ICE presence. Furthermore, a memo was sent to Caribou Coffee managers outlining how they should respond if ICE agents visit stores. This indicates that Caribou Coffee has established guidelines and protocols for handling interactions with ICE within their establishments.\nThe impact of these efforts on business operations and customer experience is notable. With Minnesota's largest employers, including Caribou Coffee, feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers following a tragic event, such as the killing of Renee Good, it is clear that these actions have influenced daily operations and employee relations at Caribou Coffee. There have been instances of backlash and customer concern regarding the company's ICE policies, as evidenced by a customer backlash initiated against Caribou Coffee over these policies. This highlights the potential negative repercussions that can arise from the implementation of certain strategies in response to external factors like ICE presence.\nDespite these challenges, Caribou Coffee maintains a strong digital presence and a diverse product portfolio aimed at enhancing customer experience. The company has also utilized new reviews during the pandemic to analyze client feedback and adjust protocols effectively, maintaining an average star rating throughout this challenging period. Caribou Coffee's strategic marketing efforts, including expansion and distribution channels, have contributed to its success in the competitive coffee industry and its ability to reach a broader customer base.\nIn conclusion, Caribou Coffee's response to the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has included specific actions and strategies aimed at addressing employee safety and customer interactions. While these efforts have had implications on business operations and customer experience, the company continues to prioritize digital engagement, product quality, and strategic marketing to navigate challenges and maintain its position in the market.\nWikipedia Writer: How has Caribou Coffee's response to the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis impacted employee relations and internal policies, considering the instructions provided to employees regarding interactions with ICE agents and the establishment of protocols for handling such situations?\nExpert: Based on the information gathered, Caribou Coffee's response to the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has had implications for employee relations and internal policies. According to a TikTok video, Caribou allegedly instructed its employees not to refuse service to ICE agents, even if they feel personally unsafe. Managers were given talking points on how to respond to customers asking about ICE presence, stating that ICE agents should be served like any other guest.\nIn light of ICE operations spreading around the country, coffee businesses and their workers, including Caribou Coffee, are increasingly feeling the effects. In Minnesota, where much of the current ICE presence is focused, brands like Starbucks and Caribou Coffee have come under fire. ICE agents have conducted raids on coffee farms in Hawaii, and cafe workers, as well as coffee shop owners, have been detained.\nFurthermore, there is a legal distinction between public and private areas of businesses, and employees may not always be aware of this. ICE officers require a judge-signed warrant to enter private areas, which is crucial for employees to understand.\nIt is evident that Caribou Coffee's response to the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has raised concerns among employees and the public. Some individuals have criticized the company for not allowing employees to refuse service to ICE agents, while others have commended the policy as a way to ensure the safety of employees. The impact of these instructions on employee relations and internal policies at Caribou Coffee is a topic of ongoing discussion and debate in the community.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide any insights on how the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has impacted the operations and customer behavior at local businesses like Caribou Coffee?\nExpert: Based on the information gathered, the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has had a significant impact on local businesses like Caribou Coffee. Increased immigration enforcement has led to a decrease in customers as fear keeps residents from leaving their homes. This has resulted in many businesses along Central Avenue in Minneapolis closing or experiencing very limited activity, with some expressing concerns about making rent and considering options for the future .\nThe \"Operation Metro Surge\" initiated by the U.S. federal government brought thousands of ICE agents into Minneapolis, which further escalated tensions between law enforcement and protesters after two Americans were killed by ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents in January . As a result, the economic consequences have been severe, with approximately 80% of immigrant-owned businesses closing in a single week along key immigrant business corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul, and many reporting sales down 50-100% .\nThe impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis has not only affected business owners but also employees and customers, with employees cutting hours and entire communities feeling the ripple effects of the ICE crackdown . A report compiled by city staff detailed $81 million in lost revenue for small businesses, $47 million in lost wages for people who were afraid to leave home, and $4.7 million in hotel cancellations extending through the summer, highlighting the extensive economic repercussions of ICE's presence .\nFurthermore, businesses like Panaderia San Miguel in Minneapolis had to close for three weeks due to federal activity in the area, reflecting the challenges faced by small businesses across the Twin Cities as a result of the heightened immigration enforcement . In response to the turmoil caused by Operation Metro Surge, hundreds of Minnesota businesses participated in a general strike to protest ICE, with the economic impact from a single day of strike expected to be in the millions, potentially costing businesses tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming weeks and months .\nOverall, the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has not only reshaped the day-to-day lives of residents but has also had a profound impact on local businesses, employees, and communities, leading to financial struggles and economic uncertainties for many in the area .\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide any specific information or examples on how the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has directly impacted businesses like Caribou Coffee in terms of sales, customer behavior, and overall operations?\nExpert: The presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has had a significant impact on local businesses, including Caribou Coffee, in terms of sales, customer behavior, and overall operations. For example, the Latino community in South Minneapolis, which holds great economic power, has seen a sharp decline in revenue for local businesses due to ICE activity driving community members to stay home. Business owners in the area have reported revenue falling by more than half over the past several weeks . Additionally, the Minneapolis City Council calculated that immigration raids and operations in the area have resulted in nearly $200 million in losses for local businesses, particularly impacting restaurants, supermarkets, laundries, and workshops run by Latino immigrants .\nFurthermore, the fear of ICE raids has led to a decrease in customer traffic and revenue for businesses. Many businesses have had to close temporarily, with some even participating in a day of \"no work, no school, no shopping\" to protest against ICE operations . The impact on employee morale and attendance has also been notable, as legal citizens are afraid to come to work due to indiscriminate ICE raids .\nOverall, the heightened immigration enforcement by ICE in Minneapolis, particularly through initiatives like \"Operation Metro Surge,\" has caused significant disruptions to local businesses, workers, and the economy. The federal invasion of the Twin Cities has led to businesses being forced to close, while also consuming significant resources of local law enforcement . This has created an environment of fear and uncertainty for business owners, employees, and customers alike, ultimately affecting the sales, operations, and overall viability of businesses like Caribou Coffee in the Minneapolis area.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide any data or statistics on the specific impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis on Caribou Coffee, such as changes in sales revenue, customer traffic, and operational challenges faced by the business?\nExpert: Based on the information available, there is no specific data or statistics directly linking the impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis on Caribou Coffee. However, it is important to note that Caribou Coffee is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and has a significant presence in the area, with approximately 473 coffeehouses in operation, including 41 franchised locations. The company's success in Minnesota, where approximately half of its coffeehouses and net sales are located, has been noted as being more profitable than its locations outside of the state. This suggests that the local market conditions, consumer preferences, and competitive landscape in Minneapolis play a significant role in Caribou Coffee's overall performance.\nAdditionally, Caribou Coffee's annual revenue has been reported to be over $500 million, indicating a substantial financial presence in the market. The company has also expanded its distribution channels beyond its coffeehouses to include grocery stores, mass retailers, club stores, and online platforms, which may help mitigate any potential challenges faced by individual locations due to external factors such as ICE presence in the area.\nIt is worth mentioning that Caribou Coffee was taken private in a $340 million deal by German equity company JAB Holding Company in December 2012, with the commitment to continue operating as an independent company with its own brand, management team, and growth strategy, remaining based in Minneapolis. This suggests a level of stability and resilience in the face of external market influences.\nIn conclusion, while specific data on the impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis on Caribou Coffee may not be available, the company's strong financial performance, strategic distribution channels, and commitment to its local presence in Minneapolis indicate a level of adaptability and success in navigating various market challenges.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide any specific examples or incidents where ICE presence in Minneapolis has affected local businesses, such as Caribou Coffee?\nExpert: The presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has had a notable impact on local businesses, including Caribou Coffee. One incident involved ICE agents visiting stores, leading Caribou Coffee to send a memo to managers outlining how to respond if ICE agents were to visit. In addition, there were reports of managers being told they could not refuse service to ICE agents, even if they feared for their safety. This caused concern among employees and customers, as seen in Twitter complaints about Caribou Coffee locations being closed unexpectedly.\nFurthermore, large employers in Minnesota, including Caribou Coffee, have been feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers in the state following the killing of Renee Good. This pressure has led to businesses like Caribou Coffee being inadvertently drawn into the resistance against ICE enforcement in the community. Additionally, local businesses, including mom-and-pop restaurants in south Minneapolis, have displayed signs saying \"No ICE\" to show solidarity with those affected by ICE actions in the area.\nIt is evident that the increased presence of ICE in Minneapolis has created a challenging environment for businesses, with some reporting significant decreases in revenue due to customers feeling uncomfortable patronizing establishments in the midst of heightened immigration enforcement. In response to the federal actions and tensions caused by ICE, many small businesses in Minnesota are resisting ICE enforcement and actively supporting their workers and neighbors rather than simply shutting down.\nOverall, the impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis has had ripple effects on businesses like Caribou Coffee, prompting managers to navigate how to respond to ICE agents, causing concerns among employees and customers, and leading to a broader community response against ICE enforcement in the area.\nWikipedia Writer: How have employees at Caribou Coffee and other local businesses in Minneapolis been directly impacted by the presence of ICE agents, in terms of job security, work environment, and relationships with coworkers and customers?\nExpert: Employees at Caribou Coffee and other local businesses in Minneapolis have been directly impacted by the presence of ICE agents in various ways.

This has led to heightened fear and anxiety among employees at businesses, such as Holy Land, where immigrant workers from Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America are worried about potential detentions.\nThe fear of ICE raids has also had a noticeable impact on the local business environment, with reports of decreased traffic at places like the Midtown Global Market due to the apprehension surrounding immigration enforcement operations. The presence of ICE agents has also sparked protests in Minneapolis, with demonstrators clashing with federal law enforcement outside a federal building.\nSome business owners, like Corey Lahm of Harriet Grove Botanicals, have expressed solidarity with protesters and closed their businesses in objection to the ICE presence in the city. Lahm saw the immigration raids as an economic threat to his business and others in his community.\nThere have been criticisms of large corporations in Minneapolis for their perceived lack of vocal response to the effects of immigration enforcement in the city, compared to smaller local businesses that have displayed signs stating \"No ICE.\" The actions of ICE agents have prompted protests in the streets, with thousands rallying against immigration enforcement following incidents like the killing of Renee Good by ICE agents.\nOverall, the presence of ICE agents in Minneapolis has created a climate of fear and uncertainty for employees at Caribou Coffee and other local businesses, impacting job security, work environments, and relationships with coworkers and customers.\nWikipedia Writer: How have businesses like Caribou Coffee in Minneapolis adapted their operations or policies in response to the presence of ICE agents and the challenges they bring to the community?\nExpert: Businesses in Minneapolis, such as Caribou Coffee, have had to adapt their operations and policies in response to the presence of ICE agents and the challenges they bring to the community.

Additionally, some grocery stores in the metro area are offering free food delivery to those impacted by ICE activity, while mutual aid organizations are providing home delivery services .\nThe federal government's increased presence in Minneapolis has led to significant disruptions in the lives of residents and local small-business owners .

The surge of federal agents in the area has prompted businesses to reassess their strategies moving forward .\nThe economic strain facing local businesses and workers as a result of ICE operations has largely been ignored by Minnesota Republican lawmakers, who have defended ICE operations without acknowledging the harm to the state's economy and key industries .

City leaders have reported that local businesses are losing millions of dollars per week, with emergency room and clinic visits in the area down by 25 percent . The killing of individuals by ICE agents has further exacerbated tensions and brought condemnation from local officials and community organizations .\nIn conclusion, businesses in Minneapolis, including Caribou Coffee, have had to navigate the challenges brought about by the presence of ICE agents in the community. From closures in solidarity with protests against ICE operations to economic strains on local businesses, the impact of ICE activities on businesses in Minneapolis has been significant and multifaceted. It is crucial for businesses to find ways to adapt and support the community during these challenging times.\nWikipedia Writer: Can you provide details on any specific incidents involving ICE presence in Minneapolis, particularly any interactions with local businesses such as Caribou Coffee?\nExpert: Based on the gathered information, there have been several incidents involving ICE presence in Minneapolis that have impacted local businesses and the community.

Our expansion plans depend on opening coffeehouses in new markets where we have little or no operating experience. The success of these new coffeehouses will be affected by the different competitive conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns of the new markets we enter, as well as our ability to generate market awareness of the Caribou Coffee brand.\n[6]\nCaribou Coffee: a strategic analysis of the firm's internal capabilities\n[7]\nThis essay discusses external and internal forces and business strategic methods caribou management has applied to remain competitive. We will write a custom essay on your topic tailored to your instructions! ... The rate of change on both cultural and social impact on the coffee industry can vary from one country to another. A good example that could highlight this is the presence of a strong coffee-drinking culture that has resulted in an increased rise of specialized shops in Australia (Alexandridis 115).\n[8]\nEmployees are pushing firms to provide clearer guidance about how to respond if Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrive at their worksites - and asking them to do more to limit agents' access to stores and parking lots. The pressures have been particularly acute at Target, a national name and one of the state's flagship employers, after the detention of two workers inside one of its suburban Minneapolis stores last month.\n[9]\nHR teams should first acknowledge that the needs of their workers may differ depending on how directly their lives are likely to be affected by ICE, said Jaye Johnson, an Atlanta-based HR and total rewards consultant whose clients include employers in the restaurant and hospitality sectors, said.\n[10]\nThere is a legal difference between public and private areas of businesses, but employees might not realize that. ICE officers need a judge-signed warrant to enter private areas. It\u2019s important for employees to know that. ... Another boycott. I\u2019m glad I have a keurig ...

Donating money and goods, sharing a meal (or getting takeout) at an immigrant-owned restaurant, or shopping at a neighborhood boutique. Across Minneapolis and surrounding areas, shop owners say the past weeks have been emotionally overwhelming, but they\u2019ve found ways to respond. Our local retailers are navigating this moment in real time, balancing survival with solidarity and the belief that small actions can make a big difference.\n[13]\nChanges in consumer preferences, such as shifts towards healthier options or alternative beverages, may also impact Caribou Coffee\u2019s sales.

This analysis explores the varying effects on these businesses and their adaptive strategies in response to changing external conditions.\n\nThe ICE presence has been notably disruptive to small businesses, particularly those owned by Hispanic entrepreneurs. These businesses have reported a sharp decline in revenue due to decreased foot traffic and heightened community anxiety[5]. The atmosphere in vibrant shopping areas has shifted, leading to fewer customers and financial strain on affected businesses[5]. \n\nCaribou Coffee, a well-established operator of gourmet coffeehouses based in Minneapolis, has also experienced shifts in its business environment[3]. While specific impacts of ICE operations on Caribou Coffee's financials are not detailed, the broader community context implies challenges.

Add inline citations (e.g., \"Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States.[1][3].\") where necessary.\n\n---\n\nThe topic of the page: Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) presence in Minneapolis, MN and its affect on Caribou Coffee and other local businesses.\n\nThe draft page:\n# Background of ICE\n\nThe U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), tasked with enforcing immigration laws and investigating criminal activities related to the border, trade, and immigration. Established in 2003, following the reorganization of federal agencies post-9/11, ICE's primary mission is to protect America from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety by enforcing laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration[1].\nICE conducts operations throughout the United States, often focusing on areas with significant immigrant populations. These operations can lead to arrests and detentions, impacting local communities and economies[2]. In Minneapolis, the presence of ICE has led to heightened tensions and organized demonstrations by local residents and businesses, many of which are aimed at pressuring the federal government to reconsider its enforcement strategies[2]. As ICE operations continue, their effects ripple through the local economy, influencing both small businesses and large corporations, which can face disruptions and loss of revenue during these enforcement actions[3][1].\nThe agency's actions have sparked significant debate and criticism, with many advocating for a reduction in harm during enforcement operations. A Reuters poll indicated that a majority of Americans believe federal agents should minimize harm to people, even if it results in fewer arrests[1]. Despite this, the Trump administration, during its tenure, defended ICE's operations and increased the number of agents to bolster immigration enforcement efforts[1].\n\n# ICE Presence in Minneapolis, MN\n\nThe presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota has been a significant issue, drawing attention from local officials, citizens, and the media. Reports of ICE activities have been noted in several areas, including Columbia Heights, downtown Minneapolis, Brooklyn Park, Burnsville, Shakopee, and St. Paul[4][5][6]. These activities have sparked protests and widespread criticism, with eyewitnesses, journalists, and lawmakers expressing concern over the operations and their impact on the community[5].\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz have both publicly criticized ICE's presence in the city. They have called for the agency to cease its operations in Minneapolis, citing disruptions to local communities and businesses[5][7]. The operations, often referred to as Operation Metro Surge, have had far-reaching effects, impacting not only individuals and families but also small businesses across the region[8][7].\nLocal media and organizations like the Minneapolis Foundation have highlighted the economic repercussions of ICE activities. R.T. Rybak, president and CEO of the foundation, noted that small businesses and their employees face significant disruptions, which in turn affects the regional economy[3]. A fund has been established to help mitigate these impacts and support those affected by the ICE operations[3].\nCoverage of the situation in Minneapolis has extended to national media, with TIME magazine featuring a cover story titled \"The Siege of an American City,\" which includes an interview with Mayor Frey. In it, Frey outlines the challenges faced by the community and the straightforward solution he sees: the departure of ICE from the city to allow businesses and communities to recover[7].\n\n# Impact on Caribou Coffee\n\nThe presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN, has had several implications for Caribou Coffee, as well as other local businesses. Employees have increasingly demanded clearer guidelines from employers, including Caribou Coffee, on how to handle ICE officers should they arrive at their worksites[9]. The need for these guidelines has become more pressing, as the emotional and social pressures in the community rise[10].\nCaribou Coffee's strategy to address these challenges aligns with its commitment to maintaining a positive impact beyond just providing high-quality, handcrafted beverages[11]. As employees become more aware of the legal distinctions between public and private business areas, it is crucial for companies like Caribou Coffee to educate their staff on their rights and protocols when dealing with ICE[12].\nFurthermore, Caribou Coffee's business strategy could be impacted by external factors such as changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions. These factors could intersect with the challenges posed by ICE presence, influencing the company's operational and financial performance[13]. The intersection of these elements highlights the complex environment that Caribou Coffee navigates in its commitment to its business strategy and community engagement.\n\n# Impact on Other Local Businesses\n\nThe presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minneapolis, particularly following the surge in raids, has created a palpable tension affecting local businesses across the region. These operations have significantly impacted the $350 billion regional economy, with business associations noting declines in sales at small businesses and reduced attendance at larger companies and agricultural operations[14][1]. The ripple effects extend from Fortune 500 companies to sole proprietors, illustrating a widespread economic challenge[14][1].\nIn response, many local businesses in Minneapolis, especially those owned by immigrants, have become more than just commercial entities. They have transformed into crucial hubs for mutual aid, fundraising, and community connection amidst an atmosphere marked by fear and grief following events like the killing of Ren\u00e9e Good[15]. Businesses are finding ways to adapt and support their communities by hosting fundraising events, donating goods, and providing spaces for community gathering, which helps maintain a sense of solidarity[15]. These small acts are crucial in sustaining the economic and social fabric of immigrant and vulnerable communities as they navigate this challenging period[16][15].\nLocal business owners have reported feeling emotionally overwhelmed by the recent events, yet they continue to strive for a balance between survival and solidarity[15]. The uncertainty brought on by ICE activities has led to significant challenges for businesses, potentially hindering their growth and recovery since 2020[17]. As these businesses face declining sales and attendance, their role in supporting their communities becomes even more critical, emphasizing the need for actions that counteract the negative economic impact of federal operations[18].\n\n# Public Opinion\n\nThe presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has generated a wide array of public opinions, particularly affecting local businesses and communities. Many residents and small business owners have expressed their concerns about the heightened immigration enforcement actions in the area. These actions have led to fear and uncertainty within immigrant communities, as well as broader economic and social impacts. Local businesses, such as those in diverse cities like Minneapolis, continue to balance safety, advocacy, and service provision to ensure the economic stability of vulnerable communities does not wane under the weight of fear[16].\nThe response from large corporations in Minneapolis has been notably more reserved compared to smaller local businesses. This is despite the city\u2019s reputation as a stronghold of progressive politics in the U.S. Midwest and a significant corporate employer[1]. Some local businesses, like Lim and Bench Pressed, have actively participated in initiatives supporting immigrant communities, raising funds for legal organizations and local mutual aid projects[15]. Additionally, many businesses took part in the statewide protest \"ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth and Freedom,\" showcasing their solidarity with the movement against ICE operations[15].\nActivists and community members have been actively encouraging participation in city council meetings to demonstrate support for resolutions calling for congressional action regarding the conduct of federal immigration officers[19]. This level of civic engagement highlights the community's desire for transparency and accountability from federal agencies. Meanwhile, Minneapolis faith communities have also been navigating tensions, with some members protesting against ICE by disrupting worship services where church leaders are affiliated with ICE[20].\nThe overall sentiment in Minneapolis reflects a complex interplay of advocacy, fear, and calls for justice, as residents and businesses grapple with the implications of ICE's presence in their city.\n\n# Comparative Analysis\n\nThe recent surge of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minneapolis has had a significant impact on local businesses, including Caribou Coffee. This analysis explores the varying effects on these businesses and their adaptive strategies in response to changing external conditions.\nThe ICE presence has been notably disruptive to small businesses, particularly those owned by Hispanic entrepreneurs. These businesses have reported a sharp decline in revenue due to decreased foot traffic and heightened community anxiety[21]. The atmosphere in vibrant shopping areas has shifted, leading to fewer customers and financial strain on affected businesses[21].\nCaribou Coffee, a well-established operator of gourmet coffeehouses based in Minneapolis, has also experienced shifts in its business environment[22]. While specific impacts of ICE operations on Caribou Coffee's financials are not detailed, the broader community context implies challenges. However, Caribou Coffee employs strategic marketing to maintain brand awareness and customer loyalty, potentially mitigating some adverse effects[23]. Their approach involves educating customers about the distinctive qualities of their brand and reinforcing positive experiences to encourage repeat business[23].\nIn contrast, the adaptive strategies of smaller, immigrant-owned businesses have focused on solidarity and community support[15]. These businesses are engaging with their communities by offering spaces for solidarity and encouraging local patronage[15]. The support from consumers, who consciously choose to spend at immigrant-owned stores, represents a vital lifeline in these challenging times[15].\n\n# Resources and Support for Affected Businesses\n\nIn response to the challenges faced by local businesses due to increased Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, various resources and support networks have been established in Minneapolis, MN, to assist affected businesses. The St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce, Minneapolis Regional Chamber, and several economic development organizations have collaborated to create an online platform that lists initiatives aimed at supporting small businesses during Operation Metro Surge. These initiatives include donations and grants, which are critical for around 40% of business owners who believe they can remain viable with external support. Additionally, about a quarter of these businesses have downsized their staff to sustain operations, while 9% are contemplating exit strategies or permanent closure [24].\nMutual aid networks and community support play a vital role in assisting businesses and communities impacted by ICE activity. Organizations such as the Community Aid Network MN and Minneapolis Mutual Aid Linktree provide mutual support contributions, food distribution, and other resources essential for sustaining local businesses. Stand With Minnesota also highlights causes to donate to, helping communities defend themselves against the negative impacts of ICE activities, which are viewed as anti-business and detrimental to economic growth [18].\nLegal advocates have noted the broader economic ripple effects caused by heightened ICE enforcement. The presence of ICE has led to operational challenges for legal service providers and economic anxiety among communities, particularly affecting immigrant communities and low-income populations. This situation discourages community members from engaging in regular activities, including supporting local businesses [16].\nIn addition to monetary support, businesses are encouraged to prepare for potential ICE enforcement actions. Resources have been made available to guide businesses on protecting their communities, staff, and operations. For instance, guidance is provided on how businesses should respond if ICE agents arrive, emphasizing the importance of reporting any incidents involving federal agents to the Attorney General, particularly if there are violations of constitutional rights or business disruptions [25][26].\n\nWrite the lead section:", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a lead section for the given Wikipedia page with the following guidelines:\n    1.

Established in 2003, following the reorganization of federal agencies post-9/11, ICE's primary mission is to protect America from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety by enforcing laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration[1].\nICE conducts operations throughout the United States, often focusing on areas with significant immigrant populations. These operations can lead to arrests and detentions, impacting local communities and economies[2]. In Minneapolis, the presence of ICE has led to heightened tensions and organized demonstrations by local residents and businesses, many of which are aimed at pressuring the federal government to reconsider its enforcement strategies[2]. As ICE operations continue, their effects ripple through the local economy, influencing both small businesses and large corporations, which can face disruptions and loss of revenue during these enforcement actions[3][1].\nThe agency's actions have sparked significant debate and criticism, with many advocating for a reduction in harm during enforcement operations. A Reuters poll indicated that a majority of Americans believe federal agents should minimize harm to people, even if it results in fewer arrests[1]. Despite this, the Trump administration, during its tenure, defended ICE's operations and increased the number of agents to bolster immigration enforcement efforts[1].\n\n# ICE Presence in Minneapolis, MN\n\nThe presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota has been a significant issue, drawing attention from local officials, citizens, and the media. Reports of ICE activities have been noted in several areas, including Columbia Heights, downtown Minneapolis, Brooklyn Park, Burnsville, Shakopee, and St. Paul[4][5][6]. These activities have sparked protests and widespread criticism, with eyewitnesses, journalists, and lawmakers expressing concern over the operations and their impact on the community[5].\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz have both publicly criticized ICE's presence in the city. They have called for the agency to cease its operations in Minneapolis, citing disruptions to local communities and businesses[5][7]. The operations, often referred to as Operation Metro Surge, have had far-reaching effects, impacting not only individuals and families but also small businesses across the region[8][7].\nLocal media and organizations like the Minneapolis Foundation have highlighted the economic repercussions of ICE activities. R.T. Rybak, president and CEO of the foundation, noted that small businesses and their employees face significant disruptions, which in turn affects the regional economy[3]. A fund has been established to help mitigate these impacts and support those affected by the ICE operations[3].\nCoverage of the situation in Minneapolis has extended to national media, with TIME magazine featuring a cover story titled \"The Siege of an American City,\" which includes an interview with Mayor Frey. In it, Frey outlines the challenges faced by the community and the straightforward solution he sees: the departure of ICE from the city to allow businesses and communities to recover[7].\n\n# Impact on Caribou Coffee\n\nThe presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN, has had several implications for Caribou Coffee, as well as other local businesses. Employees have increasingly demanded clearer guidelines from employers, including Caribou Coffee, on how to handle ICE officers should they arrive at their worksites[9]. The need for these guidelines has become more pressing, as the emotional and social pressures in the community rise[10].\nCaribou Coffee's strategy to address these challenges aligns with its commitment to maintaining a positive impact beyond just providing high-quality, handcrafted beverages[11]. As employees become more aware of the legal distinctions between public and private business areas, it is crucial for companies like Caribou Coffee to educate their staff on their rights and protocols when dealing with ICE[12].\nFurthermore, Caribou Coffee's business strategy could be impacted by external factors such as changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions.
