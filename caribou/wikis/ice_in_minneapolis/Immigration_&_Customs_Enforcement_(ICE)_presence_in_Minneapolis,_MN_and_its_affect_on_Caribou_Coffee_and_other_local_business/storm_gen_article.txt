# Background of ICE

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), tasked with enforcing immigration laws and investigating criminal activities related to the border, trade, and immigration. Established in 2003, following the reorganization of federal agencies post-9/11, ICE's primary mission is to protect America from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety by enforcing laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration[1].
ICE conducts operations throughout the United States, often focusing on areas with significant immigrant populations. These operations can lead to arrests and detentions, impacting local communities and economies[2]. In Minneapolis, the presence of ICE has led to heightened tensions and organized demonstrations by local residents and businesses, many of which are aimed at pressuring the federal government to reconsider its enforcement strategies[2]. As ICE operations continue, their effects ripple through the local economy, influencing both small businesses and large corporations, which can face disruptions and loss of revenue during these enforcement actions[3][1].
The agency's actions have sparked significant debate and criticism, with many advocating for a reduction in harm during enforcement operations. A Reuters poll indicated that a majority of Americans believe federal agents should minimize harm to people, even if it results in fewer arrests[1]. Despite this, the Trump administration, during its tenure, defended ICE's operations and increased the number of agents to bolster immigration enforcement efforts[1].

# ICE Presence in Minneapolis, MN

The presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota has been a significant issue, drawing attention from local officials, citizens, and the media. Reports of ICE activities have been noted in several areas, including Columbia Heights, downtown Minneapolis, Brooklyn Park, Burnsville, Shakopee, and St. Paul[4][5][6]. These activities have sparked protests and widespread criticism, with eyewitnesses, journalists, and lawmakers expressing concern over the operations and their impact on the community[5].
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz have both publicly criticized ICE's presence in the city. They have called for the agency to cease its operations in Minneapolis, citing disruptions to local communities and businesses[5][7]. The operations, often referred to as Operation Metro Surge, have had far-reaching effects, impacting not only individuals and families but also small businesses across the region[8][7].
Local media and organizations like the Minneapolis Foundation have highlighted the economic repercussions of ICE activities. R.T. Rybak, president and CEO of the foundation, noted that small businesses and their employees face significant disruptions, which in turn affects the regional economy[3]. A fund has been established to help mitigate these impacts and support those affected by the ICE operations[3].
Coverage of the situation in Minneapolis has extended to national media, with TIME magazine featuring a cover story titled "The Siege of an American City," which includes an interview with Mayor Frey. In it, Frey outlines the challenges faced by the community and the straightforward solution he sees: the departure of ICE from the city to allow businesses and communities to recover[7].

# Impact on Caribou Coffee

The presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN, has had several implications for Caribou Coffee, as well as other local businesses. Employees have increasingly demanded clearer guidelines from employers, including Caribou Coffee, on how to handle ICE officers should they arrive at their worksites[9]. The need for these guidelines has become more pressing, as the emotional and social pressures in the community rise[10].
Caribou Coffee's strategy to address these challenges aligns with its commitment to maintaining a positive impact beyond just providing high-quality, handcrafted beverages[11]. As employees become more aware of the legal distinctions between public and private business areas, it is crucial for companies like Caribou Coffee to educate their staff on their rights and protocols when dealing with ICE[12].
Furthermore, Caribou Coffee's business strategy could be impacted by external factors such as changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions. These factors could intersect with the challenges posed by ICE presence, influencing the company's operational and financial performance[13]. The intersection of these elements highlights the complex environment that Caribou Coffee navigates in its commitment to its business strategy and community engagement.

# Impact on Other Local Businesses

The presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minneapolis, particularly following the surge in raids, has created a palpable tension affecting local businesses across the region. These operations have significantly impacted the $350 billion regional economy, with business associations noting declines in sales at small businesses and reduced attendance at larger companies and agricultural operations[14][1]. The ripple effects extend from Fortune 500 companies to sole proprietors, illustrating a widespread economic challenge[14][1].
In response, many local businesses in Minneapolis, especially those owned by immigrants, have become more than just commercial entities. They have transformed into crucial hubs for mutual aid, fundraising, and community connection amidst an atmosphere marked by fear and grief following events like the killing of Renée Good[15]. Businesses are finding ways to adapt and support their communities by hosting fundraising events, donating goods, and providing spaces for community gathering, which helps maintain a sense of solidarity[15]. These small acts are crucial in sustaining the economic and social fabric of immigrant and vulnerable communities as they navigate this challenging period[16][15].
Local business owners have reported feeling emotionally overwhelmed by the recent events, yet they continue to strive for a balance between survival and solidarity[15]. The uncertainty brought on by ICE activities has led to significant challenges for businesses, potentially hindering their growth and recovery since 2020[17]. As these businesses face declining sales and attendance, their role in supporting their communities becomes even more critical, emphasizing the need for actions that counteract the negative economic impact of federal operations[18].

# Public Opinion

The presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has generated a wide array of public opinions, particularly affecting local businesses and communities. Many residents and small business owners have expressed their concerns about the heightened immigration enforcement actions in the area. These actions have led to fear and uncertainty within immigrant communities, as well as broader economic and social impacts. Local businesses, such as those in diverse cities like Minneapolis, continue to balance safety, advocacy, and service provision to ensure the economic stability of vulnerable communities does not wane under the weight of fear[16].
The response from large corporations in Minneapolis has been notably more reserved compared to smaller local businesses. This is despite the city’s reputation as a stronghold of progressive politics in the U.S. Midwest and a significant corporate employer[1]. Some local businesses, like Lim and Bench Pressed, have actively participated in initiatives supporting immigrant communities, raising funds for legal organizations and local mutual aid projects[15]. Additionally, many businesses took part in the statewide protest "ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth and Freedom," showcasing their solidarity with the movement against ICE operations[15].
Activists and community members have been actively encouraging participation in city council meetings to demonstrate support for resolutions calling for congressional action regarding the conduct of federal immigration officers[19]. This level of civic engagement highlights the community's desire for transparency and accountability from federal agencies. Meanwhile, Minneapolis faith communities have also been navigating tensions, with some members protesting against ICE by disrupting worship services where church leaders are affiliated with ICE[20].
The overall sentiment in Minneapolis reflects a complex interplay of advocacy, fear, and calls for justice, as residents and businesses grapple with the implications of ICE's presence in their city.

# Comparative Analysis

The recent surge of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations in Minneapolis has had a significant impact on local businesses, including Caribou Coffee. This analysis explores the varying effects on these businesses and their adaptive strategies in response to changing external conditions.
The ICE presence has been notably disruptive to small businesses, particularly those owned by Hispanic entrepreneurs. These businesses have reported a sharp decline in revenue due to decreased foot traffic and heightened community anxiety[21]. The atmosphere in vibrant shopping areas has shifted, leading to fewer customers and financial strain on affected businesses[21].
Caribou Coffee, a well-established operator of gourmet coffeehouses based in Minneapolis, has also experienced shifts in its business environment[22]. While specific impacts of ICE operations on Caribou Coffee's financials are not detailed, the broader community context implies challenges. However, Caribou Coffee employs strategic marketing to maintain brand awareness and customer loyalty, potentially mitigating some adverse effects[23]. Their approach involves educating customers about the distinctive qualities of their brand and reinforcing positive experiences to encourage repeat business[23].
In contrast, the adaptive strategies of smaller, immigrant-owned businesses have focused on solidarity and community support[15]. These businesses are engaging with their communities by offering spaces for solidarity and encouraging local patronage[15]. The support from consumers, who consciously choose to spend at immigrant-owned stores, represents a vital lifeline in these challenging times[15].

# Resources and Support for Affected Businesses

In response to the challenges faced by local businesses due to increased Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) activity, various resources and support networks have been established in Minneapolis, MN, to assist affected businesses. The St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce, Minneapolis Regional Chamber, and several economic development organizations have collaborated to create an online platform that lists initiatives aimed at supporting small businesses during Operation Metro Surge. These initiatives include donations and grants, which are critical for around 40% of business owners who believe they can remain viable with external support. Additionally, about a quarter of these businesses have downsized their staff to sustain operations, while 9% are contemplating exit strategies or permanent closure [24].
Mutual aid networks and community support play a vital role in assisting businesses and communities impacted by ICE activity. Organizations such as the Community Aid Network MN and Minneapolis Mutual Aid Linktree provide mutual support contributions, food distribution, and other resources essential for sustaining local businesses. Stand With Minnesota also highlights causes to donate to, helping communities defend themselves against the negative impacts of ICE activities, which are viewed as anti-business and detrimental to economic growth [18].
Legal advocates have noted the broader economic ripple effects caused by heightened ICE enforcement. The presence of ICE has led to operational challenges for legal service providers and economic anxiety among communities, particularly affecting immigrant communities and low-income populations. This situation discourages community members from engaging in regular activities, including supporting local businesses [16].
In addition to monetary support, businesses are encouraged to prepare for potential ICE enforcement actions. Resources have been made available to guide businesses on protecting their communities, staff, and operations. For instance, guidance is provided on how businesses should respond if ICE agents arrive, emphasizing the importance of reporting any incidents involving federal agents to the Attorney General, particularly if there are violations of constitutional rights or business disruptions [25][26].
