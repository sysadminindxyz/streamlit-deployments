[{"perspective": "Basic fact writer: Basic fact writer focusing on broadly covering the basic facts about the topic.", "dlg_turns": [{"agent_utterance": "The presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN has indeed had an impact on local businesses, including Caribou Coffee. Minnesota's largest employers, such as Caribou Coffee, are feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers in the state following the killing of Renee Good. In fact, ICE agents detained a contractor at General Mills in Chanhassen, which is a significant employer in the state. This demonstrates the tangible effects of ICE presence on businesses in the area [1].\n\nCaribou Coffee, with locations in Minneapolis, has faced challenges amidst the heightened ICE presence in the state. Despite being owned by JAB Holding Co., a private equity firm that also owns other brands like Panera and Einstein Bros. Bagels, Caribou Coffee continues to operate independently with its own brand, management team, and growth strategy, remaining based in Minneapolis [9]. This shows that despite being part of a larger conglomerate, the local identity and operations of Caribou Coffee in Minneapolis are maintained.\n\nIn terms of customer feedback, some patrons have mentioned issues with order accuracy and high sugar content in Caribou Coffee drinks. It seems that there have been instances where orders have been incorrect, which may impact customer satisfaction and retention [6]. However, Caribou Coffee continues to offer a variety of handcrafted beverages, including mochas and signature drinks like the Berry White Mocha Cooler and the Turtle Mocha, to appeal to a wide range of tastes [7].\n\nOverall, while the specific impact of ICE presence on Caribou Coffee and other local businesses may vary, the broader context of heightened enforcement activities in Minneapolis can contribute to challenges faced by businesses in the area. The unique position of Caribou Coffee as a local establishment within a larger corporate structure adds another layer of complexity to how it navigates these challenges in the face of changing immigration enforcement dynamics in the region.", "user_utterance": "Can you provide any information on how the presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN has affected local businesses, specifically Caribou Coffee and other establishments?", "search_queries": ["Impact of ICE presence on local businesses in Minneapolis, MN", "Caribou Coffee and ICE presence in Minneapolis", "Effects of ICE raids on businesses in Minneapolis"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.startribune.com/minnesotas-biggest-companies-starting-to-feel-heat-from-ice-surge/601562852", "description": "Target has declined to comment on an incident at its Richfield store filmed by bystanders, which occurred a day after ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot and killed Renee Good in south Minneapolis.

The company also provided talking points for managers on how to respond to customers inquiring about ICE presence. [10] Furthermore, a memo was sent to Caribou Coffee managers outlining how they should respond if ICE agents visit stores. [4] This indicates that Caribou Coffee has established guidelines and protocols for handling interactions with ICE within their establishments.\n\nThe impact of these efforts on business operations and customer experience is notable. With Minnesota's largest employers, including Caribou Coffee, feeling pressure due to the surge of immigration officers following a tragic event, such as the killing of Renee Good, [3] it is clear that these actions have influenced daily operations and employee relations at Caribou Coffee. There have been instances of backlash and customer concern regarding the company's ICE policies, as evidenced by a customer backlash initiated against Caribou Coffee over these policies. [22] This highlights the potential negative repercussions that can arise from the implementation of certain strategies in response to external factors like ICE presence.\n\nDespite these challenges, Caribou Coffee maintains a strong digital presence and a diverse product portfolio aimed at enhancing customer experience. [11] The company has also utilized new reviews during the pandemic to analyze client feedback and adjust protocols effectively, maintaining an average star rating throughout this challenging period.

The increased ICE activity has led to a decline in customers for businesses, with some reporting seeing as few as three to four people a day compared to the previous average of 30 to 50 customers [2]. This decrease in foot traffic has resulted in substantial revenue losses, with an estimated $81 million in lost revenue for restaurants and small businesses across the city in just one month [10].\n\nImmigrant-owned businesses have been particularly hard hit by ICE operations, with roughly 80% of immigrant-owned businesses along key corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul closing in a single week, and many reporting sales down by 50-100% [5]. The impact extends beyond just financial losses, as businesses are also facing challenges such as limited operations, staffing shortages, and fear of further confrontations with ICE agents [5]. Additionally, the entire local community is experiencing financial struggles due to the overwhelming presence of immigration officers, leading to concerns about how residents will be able to pay their bills and support local businesses [15].\n\nThe broader impact of ICE operations on local economies and communities is evident in the $81 million in lost revenue for small businesses, $47 million in lost wages for residents who are afraid to leave their homes, and $38 million in unrealized construction value [11]. The economic strain caused by ICE's presence is estimated to be between $10 million to $20 million in lost revenue per week for businesses in Minneapolis, with some reporting an 80% revenue decline year-over-year in the past two months [16].\n\nOverall, the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has reshaped the day-to-day lives of residents and business owners alike, with significant financial losses and community disruptions being felt across the city [1]. The impact of increased immigration enforcement is not only keeping residents at home but also hurting neighborhood economies, affecting not only business owners but also employees and customers [3]. The situation highlights the need for support for affected businesses and communities as they navigate the challenges posed by ICE operations in Minneapolis [8].", "user_utterance": "Can you provide more information on how the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has specifically affected businesses like Caribou Coffee and other local establishments, both in terms of financial impact and community response?", "search_queries": ["ICE presence impact on local businesses in Minneapolis", "Caribou Coffee financial impact from ICE presence", "Community response to ICE presence in Minneapolis"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/ice-presence-threatens-small-business-in-minneapolis-minnesota-some-owners-say.html", "description": "<strong>Some Minneapolis small-business owners say they fear for their personal safety, their community&#x27;s safety and their businesses&#x27; survival</strong> amid ICE&#x27;s presence in the city.", "snippets": ["The U.S. federal government's \"Operation Metro Surge\" brought thousands of ICE agents into Minneapolis beginning in December, and tensions between law enforcement and protesters escalated after two Americans \u2014 Ren\u00e9e Good and Alex Pretti \u2014 were killed by ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents in January.

The federal immigration crackdown has had a profound impact on small businesses in Minnesota, resulting in reduced foot traffic, staffing challenges, and revenue losses [22]. In response to these challenges, the Minneapolis community has come together to help one another, offering resources and assistance for those impacted by the immigration crackdown [22].\n\nAdditionally, the Paul Area Chamber of Commerce, Minneapolis Regional Chamber, and other Twin Cities-area economic development organizations have compiled an online listing of initiatives collecting donations to support small businesses during Operation Metro Surge, including links to legal guidance for employers [23].

In light of the heightened tensions and increased ICE activity in the area, local shops have been supporting the community by considering whether to close on specific days as a form of protest against ICE operations [1]. Additionally, some grocery stores in the metro area are offering free food delivery to those impacted by ICE activity, while mutual aid organizations are providing home delivery services [2].\n\nThe federal government's increased presence in Minneapolis has led to significant disruptions in the lives of residents and local small-business owners [3]. Many businesses have been less outspoken about President Trump's policies out of fear of retaliation or boycotts, as seen with a Hilton-owned Hampton Inn cancelling bookings for ICE members in early January [7]. The surge of federal agents in the area has prompted businesses to reassess their strategies moving forward [5].\n\nThe economic strain facing local businesses and workers as a result of ICE operations has largely been ignored by Minnesota Republican lawmakers, who have defended ICE operations without acknowledging the harm to the state's economy and key industries [8]. As a response to the economic crisis caused by the ICE surge, the Minneapolis Foundation has activated funds to support small businesses, including grants for immigrant-owned businesses [9]. \n\nThe impact of ICE operations on businesses has been severe, with many establishments closing or experiencing limited activity, leading to concerns about rent payments and the future viability of these businesses [16]. City leaders have reported that local businesses are losing millions of dollars per week, with emergency room and clinic visits in the area down by 25 percent [17]. The killing of individuals by ICE agents has further exacerbated tensions and brought condemnation from local officials and community organizations [18].\n\nIn conclusion, businesses in Minneapolis, including Caribou Coffee, have had to navigate the challenges brought about by the presence of ICE agents in the community. From closures in solidarity with protests against ICE operations to economic strains on local businesses, the impact of ICE activities on businesses in Minneapolis has been significant and multifaceted.

Increased immigration enforcement has led to a decrease in customers as fear keeps residents from leaving their homes. This has resulted in many businesses along Central Avenue in Minneapolis closing or experiencing very limited activity, with some expressing concerns about making rent and considering options for the future [7]. \n\nThe \"Operation Metro Surge\" initiated by the U.S. federal government brought thousands of ICE agents into Minneapolis, which further escalated tensions between law enforcement and protesters after two Americans were killed by ICE and U.S. Border Patrol agents in January [2]. As a result, the economic consequences have been severe, with approximately 80% of immigrant-owned businesses closing in a single week along key immigrant business corridors in Minneapolis and St. Paul, and many reporting sales down 50-100% [3].\n\nThe impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis has not only affected business owners but also employees and customers, with employees cutting hours and entire communities feeling the ripple effects of the ICE crackdown [8]. A report compiled by city staff detailed $81 million in lost revenue for small businesses, $47 million in lost wages for people who were afraid to leave home, and $4.7 million in hotel cancellations extending through the summer, highlighting the extensive economic repercussions of ICE's presence [9].\n\nFurthermore, businesses like Panaderia San Miguel in Minneapolis had to close for three weeks due to federal activity in the area, reflecting the challenges faced by small businesses across the Twin Cities as a result of the heightened immigration enforcement [10]. In response to the turmoil caused by Operation Metro Surge, hundreds of Minnesota businesses participated in a general strike to protest ICE, with the economic impact from a single day of strike expected to be in the millions, potentially costing businesses tens or hundreds of millions of dollars over the coming weeks and months [16].\n\nOverall, the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has not only reshaped the day-to-day lives of residents but has also had a profound impact on local businesses, employees, and communities, leading to financial struggles and economic uncertainties for many in the area [15].", "user_utterance": "Can you provide any insights on how the presence of ICE in Minneapolis has impacted the operations and customer behavior at local businesses like Caribou Coffee?", "search_queries": ["Impact of ICE presence in Minneapolis on local businesses", "Caribou Coffee response to ICE presence", "Customer behavior at Caribou Coffee after ICE presence in Minneapolis"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://spokesman-recorder.com/2026/01/23/ice-activity-impacts-local-businesses/", "description": "Rising ICE activity impacts local businesses in Minneapolis, <strong>keeping residents home and slowing local business activity</strong>.", "snippets": ["We also welcome support in the form of checks to the MSR office at 3744 4th Avenue South, Minneapolis, 55409.

The impact on employee morale and attendance has also been notable, as legal citizens are afraid to come to work due to indiscriminate ICE raids [9].\n\nOverall, the heightened immigration enforcement by ICE in Minneapolis, particularly through initiatives like \"Operation Metro Surge,\" has caused significant disruptions to local businesses, workers, and the economy. The federal invasion of the Twin Cities has led to businesses being forced to close, while also consuming significant resources of local law enforcement [18].
