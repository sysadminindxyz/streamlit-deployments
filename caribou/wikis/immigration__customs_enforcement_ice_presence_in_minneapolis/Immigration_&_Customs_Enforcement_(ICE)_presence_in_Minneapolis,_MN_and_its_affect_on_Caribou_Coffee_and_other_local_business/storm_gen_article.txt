# Background of ICE

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a federal agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), tasked with enforcing immigration laws and investigating criminal activities related to the border, trade, and immigration. Established in 2003, following the reorganization of federal agencies post-9/11, ICE's primary mission is to protect America from the cross-border crime and illegal immigration that threaten national security and public safety by enforcing laws governing border control, customs, trade, and immigration[1].
ICE conducts operations throughout the United States, often focusing on areas with significant immigrant populations. These operations can lead to arrests and detentions, impacting local communities and economies[2]. In Minneapolis, the presence of ICE has led to heightened tensions and organized demonstrations by local residents and businesses, many of which are aimed at pressuring the federal government to reconsider its enforcement strategies[2]. As ICE operations continue, their effects ripple through the local economy, influencing both small businesses and large corporations, which can face disruptions and loss of revenue during these enforcement actions[3][1].
The agency's actions have sparked significant debate and criticism, with many advocating for a reduction in harm during enforcement operations. A Reuters poll indicated that a majority of Americans believe federal agents should minimize harm to people, even if it results in fewer arrests[1]. Despite this, the Trump administration, during its tenure, defended ICE's operations and increased the number of agents to bolster immigration enforcement efforts[1].

# ICE Presence in Minneapolis, MN

The presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, Minnesota has been a significant issue, drawing attention from local officials, citizens, and the media. Reports of ICE activities have been noted in several areas, including Columbia Heights, downtown Minneapolis, Brooklyn Park, Burnsville, Shakopee, and St. Paul[4][5][6]. These activities have sparked protests and widespread criticism, with eyewitnesses, journalists, and lawmakers expressing concern over the operations and their impact on the community[5].
Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz have both publicly criticized ICE's presence in the city. They have called for the agency to cease its operations in Minneapolis, citing disruptions to local communities and businesses[5][7]. The operations, often referred to as Operation Metro Surge, have had far-reaching effects, impacting not only individuals and families but also small businesses across the region[8][7].
Local media and organizations like the Minneapolis Foundation have highlighted the economic repercussions of ICE activities. R.T. Rybak, president and CEO of the foundation, noted that small businesses and their employees face significant disruptions, which in turn affects the regional economy[3]. A fund has been established to help mitigate these impacts and support those affected by the ICE operations[3].
Coverage of the situation in Minneapolis has extended to national media, with TIME magazine featuring a cover story titled "The Siege of an American City," which includes an interview with Mayor Frey. In it, Frey outlines the challenges faced by the community and the straightforward solution he sees: the departure of ICE from the city to allow businesses and communities to recover[7].

# Impact on Caribou Coffee

The presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, MN, has presented various challenges for local businesses, including Caribou Coffee. Employees across the hospitality sector have increasingly urged their companies to provide clear guidance on how to handle situations involving ICE officers at their worksites[9]. This pressure has been particularly noticeable in Minneapolis, where businesses are navigating the balance between survival and solidarity with their workforce[10].
Caribou Coffee, known for its dedication to creating a positive impact beyond just serving coffee[11], has faced challenges related to economic uncertainty and potential disruptions. Federal operations affecting the local economy have introduced a degree of uncertainty that could impact business growth and recovery, especially following the economic setbacks experienced since 2020[12]. Moreover, any interruptions in shipping services could potentially delay coffee deliveries, increase costs, and ultimately affect revenue and profit margins[13].
In response to these external pressures, Caribou Coffee, like other businesses in the area, has had to consider its strategies for customer engagement and employee support. This includes addressing concerns related to the presence of ICE and ensuring the protection and support of their workforce[9][14]. As these dynamics continue to evolve, Caribou Coffee remains committed to navigating these challenges while maintaining strong brand loyalty among its customer base[15].

# Impact on Other Local Businesses

The intensified presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has significantly impacted local businesses, particularly those owned by immigrants. As these communities navigate the heightened tensions, local businesses and organizations are taking on roles beyond their commercial activities to serve as hubs for mutual aid and community connection during this challenging period marked by fear and grief[16][10]. Many of these businesses are actively participating in efforts to support immigrant communities by providing fundraising opportunities and acting as centers for community solidarity[10].
The economic repercussions of the ICE operations are profound. Small businesses in Minneapolis, especially in diverse areas like Lake Street, have experienced significant financial setbacks. According to estimates by the City of Minneapolis, these businesses are losing between $10 million and $20 million weekly due to lost sales, closures, and disruptions to the workforce[17]. Specifically, in December and January, businesses on Lake Street alone faced an estimated loss of approximately $46 million in revenue[17]. The broader economic impact for the city is substantial, with potential revenue losses in January 2026 for small consumer-facing businesses projected to reach as high as $81 million[18]. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that employees and customers are opting to stay home, forcing business owners to reduce operating hours, which amplifies the negative ripple effects throughout the local economy[19].
Immigrant-owned businesses are particularly vulnerable to these pressures, bearing the brunt of the losses from operations such as Operation Metro Surge[20]. Despite the challenges, many within the community are rallying to support these businesses. For example, after an anti-ICE protest on Lake Street, hundreds of people visited the Karmel Mall, a business hub for the Somali community, to show solidarity and patronize immigrant-owned establishments[20]. This indicates a community effort to sustain local businesses during a time of economic strain and uncertainty.

# Community and Business Responses

In response to the heightened presence and activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis, local businesses and the community have been actively seeking ways to support one another and mitigate the impact. Many residents have made conscious choices about where to spend their money, opting to donate, dine at immigrant-owned restaurants, or shop at local boutiques, thus making a statement of solidarity through their consumer habits[10]. The desire to support businesses owned by people of color and women has been particularly strong, with increased communication among local restaurants and businesses, such as Vinai, a restaurant owned by chef Yia Vang, being highlighted as a positive development[21].
Local businesses have been faced with challenging circumstances, needing to balance the need for survival with the desire to act in solidarity with affected communities. A significant portion of business owners, approximately 40%, indicated that their continued viability depended on external support, such as grants and donations, while others have had to downsize or consider closing permanently[22]. To address these challenges, local chambers of commerce and economic development organizations have developed online initiatives to collect donations in support of small businesses during ICE's Operation Metro Surge[22].
Community organizations and activists have also mobilized in response to ICE activities. The Minnesota Immigrant Rights Action Committee (MIRAC) organized marches, such as the one on Central Avenue Northeast, to protest ICE enforcement[23]. Furthermore, a coalition of activist groups planned rallies and marches at the Minnesota Capitol, calling on state leadership to account for their perceived inaction and to demand measures to help communities and businesses recover[24].
Legal advocates have noted the broader economic ripple effects of ICE operations, which have created both challenges for service providers and economic anxiety within the community[16]. This has led to reduced participation in daily activities, such as shopping at local businesses, due to concerns over rights and family safety[16]. To address violations of constitutional rights and other related incidents, there have been calls to report such incidents to the Attorney General[25].
In a legal context, the American Civil Liberties Union, along with other partners, filed an amended complaint with the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota, highlighting ongoing violations by federal agents, including ICE, against those observing or protesting their activities[26]. This legal action underscores the tension between federal enforcement activities and community efforts to protect their rights and businesses.

# Public Opinion

The presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has generated significant public discourse and varied reactions from the community, local businesses, and officials. A notable aspect of this discourse is the reaction from Minneapolis's diverse communities, which have been profoundly affected by ICE's operations. Many local businesses and organizations strive to balance safety, advocacy, and service provision to ensure the economic stability of immigrant and vulnerable communities, as they navigate this tense period[16].
One of the most vocal expressions of public opinion has come from the business sector. A joint statement by 60 Minnesota CEOs marked a significant shift in corporate willingness to address federal policies, highlighting a new level of engagement in political issues traditionally avoided by businesses. The breadth of participation suggests a collective hope that their actions might influence the administration's approach in Minneapolis[27].
Grassroots movements have also played a crucial role in shaping public opinion. Events such as the "ICE Out of Minnesota: Day of Truth and Freedom" protest reflect a widespread call to action against ICE operations. The economic blackout, in which businesses closed their doors in solidarity, was part of a broader movement urging "no work, no school, no shopping" to protest ICE activities[10].
Faith communities have had mixed reactions, with some tensions arising, as seen when protesters disrupted a worship service at a church led by a pastor who also serves as the local ICE field office head[28]. Additionally, local leaders and officials, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, have publicly called for an end to ICE's presence in the city, reflecting the strong opposition from various quarters[5].
The public's response to ICE activities in Minneapolis is multifaceted, with emotions running high as communities grapple with the social and economic impacts of these operations. This dynamic landscape continues to influence and reflect the evolving public sentiment towards ICE in the region.

# Comparative Analysis

The presence of Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minneapolis has had varied impacts on businesses within the city, including both small, locally-owned shops and larger chains like Caribou Coffee. Hispanic-owned small businesses have been particularly affected, experiencing significant revenue losses as vibrant shopping areas have turned into ghost towns due to heightened ICE activities and subsequent community apprehension[29]. These businesses are facing financial struggles as customers become wary of the heightened ICE presence and potential deportation threats[29][30].
In contrast, Caribou Coffee, a larger chain based in Minneapolis, has continued to focus on maintaining and enhancing its market position despite the ICE surge. The company employs marketing strategies designed to increase brand awareness and encourage repeat purchases by highlighting the distinctive qualities of their offerings[31]. While smaller businesses report financial difficulties, Caribou Coffee is pushing to evolve its product lines, catering to younger generations and ensuring a high-quality experience for customers[11]. This approach reflects a strategic resilience to external pressures, allowing Caribou Coffee to sustain operations and maintain community engagement even in challenging times[11].
The differing impacts on these businesses underscore a broader narrative of how ICE presence can affect local economies variably, depending on business size and resources. Smaller, independent businesses may not have the capacity to withstand such disruptions as effectively as larger corporations that can leverage established brand loyalty and expansive marketing strategies[29][31].
