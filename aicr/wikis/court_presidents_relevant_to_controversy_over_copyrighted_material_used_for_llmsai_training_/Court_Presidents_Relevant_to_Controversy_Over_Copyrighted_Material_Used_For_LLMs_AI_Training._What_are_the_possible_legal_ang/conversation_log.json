The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a legal debate over the use of copyrighted materials without permission from the copyright owners. There are currently more than 25 pending lawsuits involving LLMs and allegations of copyright infringement [1]. The intersection of AI development and copyright law has become increasingly complex as AI models become more sophisticated, raising legal and ethical questions about the use of copyrighted materials for training [2].\n\nCourts have ruled that copying works to train LLMs can be considered transformative under the fair use doctrine, but these decisions are based on specific facts and the law in this area is likely to continue developing [6]. The legality of using copyrighted material for AI training often depends on the terms of the publishing contract between the publisher and the author [12]. Additionally, there is a Generative AI Licensing Agreement Tracker that shows which publishers have signed licensing agreements to allow LLMs to train on scholarly content, indicating a potential avenue for resolving copyright challenges [12].\n\nThe use of copyrighted material for training generative AI platforms has been the subject of recent court decisions, such as Bartz v. Anthropic and Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, which offer insight into how other courts may address similar issues [13]. In Bartz v. Anthropic, Judge William Alsup issued a significant decision that applied the fair use doctrine to AI training on copyrighted books, marking a notable step in the evolving intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence [14].

This court order is a pivotal step in the evolving intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence, providing insights into how courts may approach similar cases in the future [4].\n\nFurthermore, a federal district court in the Northern District of California recently ruled that the use of lawfully acquired copyrighted works to train LLMs is considered fair use under U.S. copyright law. This decision highlights the court's consideration of different aspects, such as the conversion of physical copies to digital ones and the download of pirated copies for training LLMs, ultimately determining what constitutes fair use in this context [7].\n\nAdditionally, the perspective shared by OpenAI, citing the Library Copyright Alliance's position, argues that training AI models using publicly available internet materials falls under fair use, supported by long-standing precedents. This stance emphasizes the importance of understanding the nuances of fair use in the context of AI training on copyrighted material [1].\n\nOverall, the legal angles that publishers might take in addressing the controversy over the use of copyrighted material for LLMs/AI training vary based on court rulings, interpretations of fair use, and the specific circumstances surrounding the acquisition and use of copyrighted works for training AI models. It is essential for publishers to consider these legal precedents and perspectives when navigating the complex landscape of copyright law in relation to AI development.", "user_utterance": "What are the possible legal angles that publishers might take when dealing with the controversy over the use of copyrighted material for LLMs/AI training?", "search_queries": ["Legal angles publishers might take in copyright controversy LLMs/AI training", "Copyright infringement cases LLMs/AI training", "Fair use of copyrighted material LLMs/AI training"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.arl.org/blog/training-generative-ai-models-on-copyrighted-works-is-fair-use/", "description": "OpenAI has responded that \u201c<strong>training AI models using publicly available internet materials is fair use, as supported by long-standing and widely accepted precedents</strong>.\u201d In a blog post about the case, OpenAI cites the Library Copyright Alliance ...", "snippets": ["Along with other allegations, the New York Times claims that Microsoft and OpenAI are infringing copyright when they train their large language models (LLMs) on material copyrighted by the Times.

The legal debate surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training has led to a significant number of lawsuits, including a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by the New York Times against Microsoft and OpenAI. This underscores the pressing need for publishers to carefully assess their legal obligations when it comes to using copyrighted material for AI training [1].\n\nOne critical consideration for publishers is the application of the fair use doctrine in AI development. Recent court decisions, such as Bartz v. Anthropic, have set important precedents in delineating the boundaries of copyright law in the context of AI training. Judge William Alsup's ruling in Bartz v. Anthropic marked a significant step in applying the fair use doctrine to AI training on copyrighted books, highlighting the evolving intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence [4].\n\nAdditionally, the use of pirated copies in data sets for training AI models poses a significant risk of infringement liability for AI providers. While AI models like LLMs require vast amounts of textual content for training, much of which is protected by copyright, the legality of using such material without permission remains a crucial legal question. The courts have made it clear that the unauthorized use of copyrighted material, particularly pirated copies, for AI training may not fall under fair use exceptions and could lead to legal repercussions [5].\n\nFurthermore, recent court rulings, such as the decision in Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, have provided insight into how courts may address similar issues related to the use of copyrighted material for training AI platforms. These decisions emphasize the importance of ensuring that AI companies do not engage in piracy or unauthorized use of copyrighted works for training purposes, as this could result in legal challenges and infringement claims [14].\n\nOverall, publishers must carefully navigate the legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted material for LLMs and AI training, considering factors such as fair use, piracy, and recent court decisions to ensure compliance with copyright law and mitigate the risk of infringement liability.", "user_utterance": "What are the key considerations for publishers in determining whether the use of copyrighted material for LLMs/AI training falls under fair use or other exceptions to copyright law?", "search_queries": ["Fair use of copyrighted material in LLMs/AI training", "Legal considerations for publishers using copyrighted material in educational settings", "Court cases on fair use and copyrighted material in educational contexts"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.arl.org/blog/training-generative-ai-models-on-copyrighted-works-is-fair-use/", "description": "OpenAI has responded that \u201c<strong>training AI models using publicly available internet materials is fair use, as supported by long-standing and widely accepted precedents</strong>.\u201d In a blog post about the case, OpenAI cites the Library Copyright Alliance ...", "snippets": ["ARL and ALA are founding members of the Library Copyright Alliance (LCA).

The court found that Meta's use of copyrighted works to train LLMs constituted fair use based on the transformative nature of the LLMs and the lack of impact on the authors' market [7]. This decision highlights the importance of considering fair use under Section 107 of the Copyright Act when using copyrighted material for AI training purposes.\n\nMoreover, the court's ruling in Kadrey v. Meta emphasized the significance of the market impact in fair use analysis [6]. While Meta initially attempted to negotiate licensing deals with major publishers to use their books for training, it ultimately faced challenges in securing these licenses [8]. This case serves as a roadmap for how marketers, publishers, and content owners approach visibility, data access, and intellectual property in the age of AI [4].\n\nIn Kadrey v. Meta, the court addressed the issue of using shadow libraries to obtain copyrighted works for AI training and determined that the copying from pirate sites was part of a single process directed at training the AI, rather than focusing on the source of the texts [6]. The court's decision sets a precedent for future cases involving generative AI and copyrighted material, emphasizing the need for a well-developed record on the market effects of the defendant's use [14]. This ruling underscores the complexity of the legal debate surrounding the use of copyrighted materials to train AI systems without permission from the copyright owners [21].\n\nIn conclusion, recent court rulings like Kadrey v.
