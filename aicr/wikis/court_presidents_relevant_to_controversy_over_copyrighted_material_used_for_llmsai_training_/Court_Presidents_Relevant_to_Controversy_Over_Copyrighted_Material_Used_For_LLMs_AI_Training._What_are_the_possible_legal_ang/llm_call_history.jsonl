The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a legal debate over the use of copyrighted materials without permission from the copyright owners. There are currently more than 25 pending lawsuits involving LLMs and allegations of copyright infringement . The intersection of AI development and copyright law has become increasingly complex as AI models become more sophisticated, raising legal and ethical questions about the use of copyrighted materials for training .\nCourts have ruled that copying works to train LLMs can be considered transformative under the fair use doctrine, but these decisions are based on specific facts and the law in this area is likely to continue developing . The legality of using copyrighted material for AI training often depends on the terms of the publishing contract between the publisher and the author . Additionally, there is a Generative AI Licensing Agreement Tracker that shows which publishers have signed licensing agreements to allow LLMs to train on scholarly content, indicating a potential avenue for resolving copyright challenges .\nThe use of copyrighted material for training generative AI platforms has been the subject of recent court decisions, such as Bartz v. Anthropic and Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, which offer insight into how other courts may address similar issues . In Bartz v. Anthropic, Judge William Alsup issued a significant decision that applied the fair use doctrine to AI training on copyrighted books, marking a notable step in the evolving intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence . This highlights the ongoing legal debate surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training and the importance of addressing copyright challenges in the development of AI technologies.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an experienced Wikipedia writer and want to edit a specific page.

The legal debate surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training has led to a significant number of lawsuits, including a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by the New York Times against Microsoft and OpenAI. This underscores the pressing need for publishers to carefully assess their legal obligations when it comes to using copyrighted material for AI training .\nOne critical consideration for publishers is the application of the fair use doctrine in AI development. Recent court decisions, such as Bartz v. Anthropic, have set important precedents in delineating the boundaries of copyright law in the context of AI training. Judge William Alsup's ruling in Bartz v. Anthropic marked a significant step in applying the fair use doctrine to AI training on copyrighted books, highlighting the evolving intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence .\nAdditionally, the use of pirated copies in data sets for training AI models poses a significant risk of infringement liability for AI providers. While AI models like LLMs require vast amounts of textual content for training, much of which is protected by copyright, the legality of using such material without permission remains a crucial legal question. The courts have made it clear that the unauthorized use of copyrighted material, particularly pirated copies, for AI training may not fall under fair use exceptions and could lead to legal repercussions .\nFurthermore, recent court rulings, such as the decision in Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, have provided insight into how courts may address similar issues related to the use of copyrighted material for training AI platforms. These decisions emphasize the importance of ensuring that AI companies do not engage in piracy or unauthorized use of copyrighted works for training purposes, as this could result in legal challenges and infringement claims .\nOverall, publishers must carefully navigate the legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted material for LLMs and AI training, considering factors such as fair use, piracy, and recent court decisions to ensure compliance with copyright law and mitigate the risk of infringement liability.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You are an experienced Wikipedia writer and want to edit a specific page.

What are the possible legal angles that publishers might take?\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are some common defenses that entities may raise when facing copyright infringement claims for using copyrighted material in LLMs/AI training programs, and how have courts typically responded to these defenses in relevant cases?\n\nGathered information:\n[1]: Alsup concluded that the full retention of the legally acquired works favored fair use as the purpose was to create a training library. Conversely, he concludes that the retention of pirated works weighs against fair use because the retention of pirated works is inherently infringement. As for the training of specific LLMs, this factor also favored fair use.\n[2]: Indeed, Judge Chhabria expressed frustration at needing to reach a finding of fair use: \u201cGiven the state of the record, the Court has no choice but to grant summary judgment \u2026 [A]s should now be clear, this ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful. It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d \u00b7 LLMs present unique challenges from a fair use perspective.\n[3]: The courts held that training large language models (LLMs) on copyrighted materials can be \u201ctransformative,\u201d a central consideration in the fair use analysis. However, the judges diverged on the legal significance of that finding, particularly when weighted against potential market harm to authors.\n[4]: Along with other allegations, the New York Times claims that Microsoft and OpenAI are infringing copyright when they train their large language models (LLMs) on material copyrighted by the Times. OpenAI has responded that \u201ctraining AI models using publicly available internet materials is fair use, as supported by long-standing and widely accepted precedents.\u201d In a blog post about the case, OpenAI cites the Library Copyright Alliance (LCA) position that \u201cbased on well-established precedent, the ingestion of copyrighted works to create large language models or other AI training databases generally is a fair use.\u201d LCA explained this position in our submission to the US Copyright Office notice of inquiry on copyright and AI, and in the LCA Principles for Copyright and AI.\n[5]: Copyright law is not a sufficient legal framework for fair development of AI, but this is not an anti-AI argument.\n[6]: Two judges have now held that copying works to train LLMs is \u201ctransformative\u201d under the fair use doctrine. Developers should be cautious, however, as these decisions are creatures of their particular facts\u2014the law in this area will likely develop further. Because judges have given great weight to the provenance of the work being used to train the LLM, developers should ensure that any works used for training are acquired legally.\n[7]: The rapid rise of generative AI has thrust the question of \u201cfair use\u201d into the legal spotlight, especially as courts grapple with whether using copyrighted works to train AI models without permission is lawful.\n[8]: Companies building their own models should ensure that all training data is lawfully sourced. Businesses that license or integrate AI tools should ensure that contracts contain appropriate representations and risk allocation terms. In Bartz v. Anthropic, Judge William Alsup issued a significant decision that delineates the copyright boundaries governing generative AI development. This is the first federal court order to meaningfully apply the fair use doctrine to AI training on copyrighted books, marking an important step in the evolving intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence.\n[9]: The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked a pressing legal debate over how copyrighted materials can be used to train generative AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), without permission from the copyright owners. Currently, there are more than 25 pending suits involving LLMs and allegations of copyright infringement.\n[10]: They argue that this method of acquisition undermines any fair use defense. Obtaining copyrighted works without authorization, whether through piracy or scraping from restricted-access websites, raises unresolved legal questions that could have significant implications for how LLMs are trained. Judge Alsup\u2019s reasoning highlights a key technical and legal feature of generative AI: models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude are trained on massive datasets, but they do not store those training materials.\n[11]: A federal district court in the Northern District of California has ruled that the use of lawfully acquired copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) is a fair use under U.S. copyright law. The court\u2019s opinion considered three separate uses to conclude that: (1) use of copyrighted material to train LLMs\n[12]: You can\u2019t Captain Hook your way through training LLMs.To amass your treasure, you can\u2019t loot the open seas of creative content without a proper Letter of Marque (i.e. you pay for using content). These rulings are a partial victory for both creators and AI companies\u2014and they chart out a map for future legal battles.\n[13]: However, the court here was less concerned with whether the source material was obtained legally in finding there was fair use. The decision emphasized that fair use is a fact-specific, holistic inquiry, with the most important factor being the effect on the market for the original work.

What are the possible legal angles that publishers might take?\n\nQuestion:\nWhat are some common defenses that entities may raise when facing copyright infringement claims for using copyrighted material in LLMs/AI training programs, and how have courts typically responded to these defenses in relevant cases?\n\nGathered information:\n[1]: Alsup concluded that the full retention of the legally acquired works favored fair use as the purpose was to create a training library. Conversely, he concludes that the retention of pirated works weighs against fair use because the retention of pirated works is inherently infringement. As for the training of specific LLMs, this factor also favored fair use.\n[2]: Indeed, Judge Chhabria expressed frustration at needing to reach a finding of fair use: \u201cGiven the state of the record, the Court has no choice but to grant summary judgment \u2026 [A]s should now be clear, this ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful. It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d \u00b7 LLMs present unique challenges from a fair use perspective.\n[3]: The courts held that training large language models (LLMs) on copyrighted materials can be \u201ctransformative,\u201d a central consideration in the fair use analysis. However, the judges diverged on the legal significance of that finding, particularly when weighted against potential market harm to authors.\n[4]: Along with other allegations, the New York Times claims that Microsoft and OpenAI are infringing copyright when they train their large language models (LLMs) on material copyrighted by the Times. OpenAI has responded that \u201ctraining AI models using publicly available internet materials is fair use, as supported by long-standing and widely accepted precedents.\u201d In a blog post about the case, OpenAI cites the Library Copyright Alliance (LCA) position that \u201cbased on well-established precedent, the ingestion of copyrighted works to create large language models or other AI training databases generally is a fair use.\u201d LCA explained this position in our submission to the US Copyright Office notice of inquiry on copyright and AI, and in the LCA Principles for Copyright and AI.\n[5]: Copyright law is not a sufficient legal framework for fair development of AI, but this is not an anti-AI argument.\n[6]: Two judges have now held that copying works to train LLMs is \u201ctransformative\u201d under the fair use doctrine. Developers should be cautious, however, as these decisions are creatures of their particular facts\u2014the law in this area will likely develop further. Because judges have given great weight to the provenance of the work being used to train the LLM, developers should ensure that any works used for training are acquired legally.\n[7]: The rapid rise of generative AI has thrust the question of \u201cfair use\u201d into the legal spotlight, especially as courts grapple with whether using copyrighted works to train AI models without permission is lawful.\n[8]: Companies building their own models should ensure that all training data is lawfully sourced. Businesses that license or integrate AI tools should ensure that contracts contain appropriate representations and risk allocation terms. In Bartz v. Anthropic, Judge William Alsup issued a significant decision that delineates the copyright boundaries governing generative AI development. This is the first federal court order to meaningfully apply the fair use doctrine to AI training on copyrighted books, marking an important step in the evolving intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence.\n[9]: The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked a pressing legal debate over how copyrighted materials can be used to train generative AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), without permission from the copyright owners. Currently, there are more than 25 pending suits involving LLMs and allegations of copyright infringement.\n[10]: They argue that this method of acquisition undermines any fair use defense. Obtaining copyrighted works without authorization, whether through piracy or scraping from restricted-access websites, raises unresolved legal questions that could have significant implications for how LLMs are trained. Judge Alsup\u2019s reasoning highlights a key technical and legal feature of generative AI: models like Anthropic\u2019s Claude are trained on massive datasets, but they do not store those training materials.\n[11]: A federal district court in the Northern District of California has ruled that the use of lawfully acquired copyrighted works to train artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) is a fair use under U.S. copyright law. The court\u2019s opinion considered three separate uses to conclude that: (1) use of copyrighted material to train LLMs\n[12]: You can\u2019t Captain Hook your way through training LLMs.To amass your treasure, you can\u2019t loot the open seas of creative content without a proper Letter of Marque (i.e. you pay for using content). These rulings are a partial victory for both creators and AI companies\u2014and they chart out a map for future legal battles.\n[13]: However, the court here was less concerned with whether the source material was obtained legally in finding there was fair use. The decision emphasized that fair use is a fact-specific, holistic inquiry, with the most important factor being the effect on the market for the original work. Market harm: In contrast to the Anthropic ruling, the court in Meta was far more persuaded by the argument that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted works, specifically for training its LLM, could significantly harm the market for the original copyrighted works, noting that the harm of \u201cmarket dilution\u201d in a marketplace flooded by AI-generated works could successfully crowd out many authors.\n[14]: Both Anthropic and Meta welcomed the rulings, with an Anthropic spokesperson stating, \u201cWe are pleased that the Court recognized that using \u2018works to train LLMs was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so\u2019\u201d and affirming that \u201cAnthropic\u2019s LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different.\u201d A Meta spokesperson similarly stated: \u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology.\u201d\n[15]: Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett & Dunner, LLP is one of the largest IP law firms in the world.

Companies building their own AI models are advised to ensure that all training data is lawfully sourced and that contracts contain appropriate terms to address copyright issues.\nOverall, the use of lawfully acquired copyrighted works to train LLMs has been recognized as transformative and fair use in certain cases, highlighting the evolving legal landscape surrounding AI training and copyright law. It is essential for developers to be cautious and consider the legal implications of using copyrighted materials for AI training to avoid potential copyright infringement claims.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-D35FbmKZCyWNV0NJXSDSxkBaectOP", "created": 1769627539, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": null, "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "explore the potential impact of court presidents in cases involving the unauthorized use of copyrighted material in LLMs/AI training programs.

Stability AI, LTD., 3:23-cv-00201-WHO [Dkt.\n[11]: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, rely heavily on analyzing massive amounts of textual data. To be effective, these AI models must ingest billions of words to learn language patterns, style, factual content, and contextual information. Because the vast majority of text-based knowledge created in the last century\u2014including books, journalism, source code, and artistic expression\u2014is protected by copyright law, these AI systems inevitably encounter the challenge of training on copyrighted content.\n[12]: ChatGPT and similar generative AI tools rely on large language models (LLMs). The business community, and society at large, seems convinced that AI powered by LLMs holds great promise for increases in efficiency. But multiple lawsuits alleging copyright infringement could create a drag on development of LLMs.\n[13]: For the time being, these recent rulings clarify that there are potentially lawful avenues for training LLMs using copyrighted materials. The legitimacy of the source of those copyrighted materials appears to be a factor upon which this analysis may turn, but it is unclear as yet what significance that factor may hold in the analysis. And continuing efforts to ensure the AI output is not infringing appear to be relevant. Businesses seeking to utilize large datasets for LLM training should prioritize comprehensive compliance strategies, including thorough vetting of all data sources to help minimize risk, and express policies and practices to mitigate the possibility of infringing output.\n[14]: \u201cFair use is the great white whale of American copyright law.

Keep in mind that, while these examples were blindingly obvious, it may be less so in practice.

The latter might include the ability to summarize texts or quote verbatim from it. (Such RAG uses implicate rights that fall more squarely within the publisher\u2019s subsidiary rights.)\n[4]: While LLMs are a significant and new technology and may be capable of multiple non-infringing uses, not every use of them with copyrighted material is transformative.\n[5]: Music industry enters (2023\u20132024): Labels and artists push back against AI-generated music trained on copyrighted catalogs. Result: Content creators across text, image, and audio industries united in a single narrative: \u201cLLMs are trained on our work. We deserve compensation.\u201d ... Required LLM developers to disclose training datasets. Proposed rules on copyright compliance and opt-outs for publishers.\n[6]: by Kevin Breen This article is the fourth in a biweekly series examining AI and its implications for publishers and authors. More than those in most industries, literarians like to spend their time and money in ways that align with their values. We love to support independent bookstores and presses whenever possible.\n[7]: Furthermore, it explores the concept of \"making available\" in the context of LLMs and its implications for copyright infringement. Recognizing the legal uncertainties and the need for a balanced approach that fosters both innovation and copyright protection, the authors propose licensing as a key solution. They advocate for a combination of direct and collective licensing models to provide a practical framework for the responsible use of copyrighted materials in AI systems.\n[8]: Artificial Intelligence is now a cornerstone of publishing whether authors want to admit it or not. AI tools and large language models (LLMs) are being used not just to write sections of manuscripts but also to help with the editing process and with the review process for scholarly journals.\n[9]: Unlock the secrets of copyright compliance with our expert insights.

Stability AI, LTD., 3:23-cv-00201-WHO [Dkt.\n[11]: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models, particularly large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude, rely heavily on analyzing massive amounts of textual data. To be effective, these AI models must ingest billions of words to learn language patterns, style, factual content, and contextual information. Because the vast majority of text-based knowledge created in the last century\u2014including books, journalism, source code, and artistic expression\u2014is protected by copyright law, these AI systems inevitably encounter the challenge of training on copyrighted content.\n[12]: ChatGPT and similar generative AI tools rely on large language models (LLMs). The business community, and society at large, seems convinced that AI powered by LLMs holds great promise for increases in efficiency. But multiple lawsuits alleging copyright infringement could create a drag on development of LLMs.\n[13]: For the time being, these recent rulings clarify that there are potentially lawful avenues for training LLMs using copyrighted materials. The legitimacy of the source of those copyrighted materials appears to be a factor upon which this analysis may turn, but it is unclear as yet what significance that factor may hold in the analysis. And continuing efforts to ensure the AI output is not infringing appear to be relevant. Businesses seeking to utilize large datasets for LLM training should prioritize comprehensive compliance strategies, including thorough vetting of all data sources to help minimize risk, and express policies and practices to mitigate the possibility of infringing output.\n[14]: \u201cFair use is the great white whale of American copyright law. Enthralling, enigmatic, protean, it endlessly fascinates us even as it defeats our every attempt to subdue it.\u201d \u2013 Paul Goldstein __________________________ This is the second in a 3-part series of posts on Large Language Models (LLMs) and copyright.\n[15]: For LLMs, the critical piece of knowledge is that output needs to be checked, and that it is insufficient to assume that generated text is always novel. Keep in mind that, while these examples were blindingly obvious, it may be less so in practice. It is a good idea, if you are producing a large amount of text, to use a search engine for snippets, on the off-chance that the model has coincidentally duplicated previously-published material.\n[16]: Unlock the secrets of copyright compliance with our expert insights.

The legal debate surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training has led to a significant number of lawsuits, including a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by the New York Times against Microsoft and OpenAI. This underscores the pressing need for publishers to carefully assess their legal obligations when it comes to using copyrighted material for AI training .\nOne critical consideration for publishers is the application of the fair use doctrine in AI development. Recent court decisions, such as Bartz v. Anthropic, have set important precedents in delineating the boundaries of copyright law in the context of AI training. Judge William Alsup's ruling in Bartz v.

Meta Platforms, have significantly influenced publishers' strategies and approaches to using copyrighted material for training AI platforms. In the case of Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, the US District Court in Northern California issued a summary judgment in favor of Meta, ruling that Meta did not infringe upon the plaintiffs' copyrights by using their books to train its large language models (LLMs) . The court found that Meta's use of copyrighted works to train LLMs constituted fair use based on the transformative nature of the LLMs and the lack of impact on the authors' market . This decision highlights the importance of considering fair use under Section 107 of the Copyright Act when using copyrighted material for AI training purposes.\nMoreover, the court's ruling in Kadrey v. Meta emphasized the significance of the market impact in fair use analysis .

The legal debate surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training has led to a significant number of lawsuits, including a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by the New York Times against Microsoft and OpenAI. This underscores the pressing need for publishers to carefully assess their legal obligations when it comes to using copyrighted material for AI training .\nOne critical consideration for publishers is the application of the fair use doctrine in AI development. Recent court decisions, such as Bartz v. Anthropic, have set important precedents in delineating the boundaries of copyright law in the context of AI training. Judge William Alsup's ruling in Bartz v. Anthropic marked a significant step in applying the fair use doctrine to AI training on copyrighted books, highlighting the evolving intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence .\nAdditionally, the use of pirated copies in data sets for training AI models poses a significant risk of infringement liability for AI providers.

Consumers should expect more legal battles over who owns the content they see online and how it was created, since some AI-generated text, images, or music may be based on copyrighted works, raising important questions about originality and ownership. As the law catches up to the rapid growth of AI, courts are beginning to set boundaries for how creative works can be used to power new technology.\n[2]: In the first major AI copyright ruling, the federal district court in Thomson Reuters Enterprise Centre GMBH v. Ross Intelligence Inc. handed down a win for copyright owners, finding that the fair use defense did not protect a competitor\u2019s use of copyrighted works to train its AI technology. Judge Stephanos Bibas granted summary judgment in favor of legal research giant Thomson Reuters on its claims of direct copyright infringement and ruled against its competitor Ross Intelligence (Ross) on its various defenses, including fair use.\n[3]: Two recent summary judgment decisions out of the Northern District of California, issued only two days apart, highlight the complexity of deciding whether the unauthorized use of copyrighted works to train large language models (LLMs) is infringement or fair use.1 In Bartz v. Anthropic PBC (Judge Alsup, June 23, 2025) and Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (Judge Chhabria, June 25, 2025), authors alleged that their works had been used without permission to train LLMs.2 In each case, the court found that, on the facts before it, the use of copyrighted works to train an AI model was highly transformative and fair use.\n[4]: In two recent Northern District of California decisions, AI companies prevailed on a fair use defense after being accused of infringing copyrights in works used to train AI models.1 The decisions, on their face, seem to contrast with an earlier District of Delaware ruling that an AI company was not protected by the doctrine of fair use.2 In this article, we review the court\u2019s reasoning in each of these three cases to elucidate how the battle for a fair use finding is playing out for AI companies, and what this means for future cases.\n[5]: The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked a pressing legal debate over how copyrighted materials can be used to train generative AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), without permission from the copyright owners. Currently, there are more than 25 pending suits involving LLMs and allegations of copyright infringement. LLMs are designed to assimilate vast amounts of text, enabling them to generate new content such as books, artwork, music, or computer code. Recently, a federal court in California issued two separate decisions that established new boundaries for what constitutes \u201cfair use\u201d of copyrighted material to train LLMs.\n[6]: No established right to licensing fees: Both courts accepted that fair use was a legitimate defense to the unauthorized use of copyrighted materials in the AI training process, and thus rejected the notion that copyright owners are inherently entitled to licensing markets for AI training absent proving actual market harm.\n[7]: Two decisions addressing fair use in the context of GenAI training came out of the Northern District of California. The decisions turn on the courts' analysis of the four \"fair use\" factors under the Copyright Act: (1) the purpose and character of the use; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for the work.\n[8]: Jan 5 (Reuters) - The sprawling legal fight over tech companies' vast copying of copyrighted material to train their artificial intelligence systems could be entering a decisive phase in 2026.\n[9]: But, the court held, it was not fair use for Anthropic to download pirated books and maintain them in a \"central library,\" only parts of which were used for AI training. On July 17, the court certified a class action for copyright owners of books Anthropic had downloaded from certain pirate libraries. In the other case, Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, Inc., a different judge ruled that, based on the record before the court, it was fair use for Meta to train a generative AI system (Llama) on books it downloaded from pirated \"shadow libraries.\"\n[10]: The decision was described as a \"landmark ruling on TDM exceptions for AI training data\" in Germany and EU more generally. The plaintiff has filed an appeal against the decision. Indian news agency ANI sued OpenAI before the Delhi High Court in India. The suit claims that OpenAI's ChatGPT reproduces ANI's copyrighted news content without authorization, amounting to copyright infringement and unauthorized use of proprietary journalistic material.\n[11]: On February 11, a judge in the U.S. District Court of Delaware issued an opinion in a long-running AI copyright infringement case, rejecting the defendant\u2019s fair use defense and finding it liable for direct copyright infringement. The case was one of the first brought by a copyright owner for the unauthorized use of its works for AI training, and, after many twists and turns, it\u2019s the first to provide an answer to the fair use question.\n[12]: The outcomes of these lawsuits could reshape how AI models are trained and whether companies must license materials from content creators.

(Such RAG uses implicate rights that fall more squarely within the publisher\u2019s subsidiary rights.)\n[9]: The spokesperson states that the royalties from these deals will be paid out to authors of the licensed content, and the licensed content can be used only for training the AI tools with no permission granted to reproduce the content in any format. Similarly to Taylor & Francis, a Wiley spokesperson said that the royalties from their agreement will also be paid to book authors and other publishing partners. They are also monitoring the developer\u2019s material for any use of copyrighted material without permission.\n[10]: High-profile lawsuits\u2014like those brought by novelists against tech giants\u2014have focused on whether feeding large volumes of creative works into foundation models (the broad, general-purpose AI systems) for training is fair use under copyright law. While the law remains unsettled, these cases are critical for authors, publishers, and other creators whose works are widely used in foundational AI training. But for many companies, the real value lies not in mass-market creative content, but in specialized, proprietary materials\u2014think clinical guidelines in healthcare, claims data in insurance, or operational and performance data in data center management.\n[11]: Why are scholars and librarians so invested in protecting the precedent that training AI LLMs on copyright-protected works is a transformative fair use? Rachael G. Samberg, Timothy Vollmer, and Samantha Teremi (of UC Berkeley Library) recently wrote that maintaining the continued treatment of training AI models as fair use is \u201cessential to protecting research,\u201d including non-generative, nonprofit educational research methodologies like text and data mining (TDM). If fair use rights were overridden and licenses restricted researchers to training AI on public domain works, scholars would be limited in the scope of inquiries that can be made using AI tools.\n[12]: U.S. Copyright Office Copyright and Artificial Intelligence, Part 3: Generative AI Training ...

If a model memorizes and regurgitates protected material, that could constitute infringement. The USCO also avoided recommending compulsory licensing, favoring instead the emergence of voluntary and extended collective licensing systems to manage the complexity of content ownership and permissions.\n[14]: An article in Publishers Weekly notes this licensing would be limited to internal use for licensees, which means it would not extend to public-facing models such as ChatGPT. However, it\u2019s easy to see how such licensing could eventually turn into something more extensive. What is the CCC?

Similarly to Taylor & Francis, a Wiley spokesperson said that the royalties from their agreement will also be paid to book authors and other publishing partners. They are also monitoring the developer\u2019s material for any use of copyrighted material without permission.\n[10]: High-profile lawsuits\u2014like those brought by novelists against tech giants\u2014have focused on whether feeding large volumes of creative works into foundation models (the broad, general-purpose AI systems) for training is fair use under copyright law. While the law remains unsettled, these cases are critical for authors, publishers, and other creators whose works are widely used in foundational AI training. But for many companies, the real value lies not in mass-market creative content, but in specialized, proprietary materials\u2014think clinical guidelines in healthcare, claims data in insurance, or operational and performance data in data center management.\n[11]: Why are scholars and librarians so invested in protecting the precedent that training AI LLMs on copyright-protected works is a transformative fair use? Rachael G. Samberg, Timothy Vollmer, and Samantha Teremi (of UC Berkeley Library) recently wrote that maintaining the continued treatment of training AI models as fair use is \u201cessential to protecting research,\u201d including non-generative, nonprofit educational research methodologies like text and data mining (TDM). If fair use rights were overridden and licenses restricted researchers to training AI on public domain works, scholars would be limited in the scope of inquiries that can be made using AI tools.\n[12]: U.S. Copyright Office Copyright and Artificial Intelligence, Part 3: Generative AI Training ... Developers may also incorporate training data from licensed or non-public sources. Some own or have access to data acquired through interactions with customers or users.76 They \u00b7 may also license data from third parties,77 such as traditional publishers, intermediaries, and \u00b7 specialized data providers. Developers may find such material particularly desirable because it\n[13]: Crucially, the USCO rejected the argument that training on copyrighted content is inherently fair use, cautioning that language models don\u2019t just learn meaning\u2014they absorb the arrangement and structure of linguistic expression. If a model memorizes and regurgitates protected material, that could constitute infringement. The USCO also avoided recommending compulsory licensing, favoring instead the emergence of voluntary and extended collective licensing systems to manage the complexity of content ownership and permissions.\n[14]: An article in Publishers Weekly notes this licensing would be limited to internal use for licensees, which means it would not extend to public-facing models such as ChatGPT. However, it\u2019s easy to see how such licensing could eventually turn into something more extensive. What is the CCC? It is a for-profit company that manages collective copyright licensing for corporate and academic publishers.\n[15]: Where the courts diverge is in their application of the fourth fair use factor under copyright law and the impact that the above transformative use has\n\nNow give your response.

Anthropic PBC (June 23, 2025), and another by Judge Vince Chhabria in Richard Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (June 25, 2025), are beginning to establish a framework for how federal courts will address the intersection of copyright, AI training, and the boundaries of fair use.\n[2]\nOn the other hand, the courts have evolved a set of criteria which, though in no case definitive or determinative, provide some gauge for balancing the equities. These criteria have been stated in various ways, but essentially they can all be reduced to the four standards which have been adopted in section 107: \u201c(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\u201d\n[3]\nMany federal courts issue rulings that are significant or come to be influential, but those are outside the scope of this list. Because they share a clause of the Constitution and much the same justifications, there is considerable overlap between patent and copyright jurisprudence.\nOver the decades since, copyright in the United States has become a more complicated system with longer terms and more tests, and has been the subject of many decisions by the Court. The Supreme Court was the source of a number of concepts in the field, including fair use, the idea-expression divide, the useful articles or separability doctrine, and the uncopyrightability of federal documents.\n[4]\n[A]s should now be clear, this ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful. It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d \u00b7 LLMs present unique challenges from a fair use perspective.\n[5]\nThe effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. ... Two recent cases in which courts have considered a fair use argument are Hachette v.

Recently, a federal court in California issued two separate decisions that established new boundaries for what constitutes \u201cfair use\u201d of copyrighted material to train LLMs.\n[8]\nThe recent federal court finding\u2014that using copyrighted books to train an AI large language model (LLM) qualifies as fair use\u2014provides some guidance for companies developing or deploying generative AI systems and for businesses that rely on AI vendors.

And now other publishers are getting in on the action, putting their money (and extensive archive of materials) where their mouth is to try and improve AI\u2019s potential in scholarly publishing. As AI use becomes more widespread, multiple publishers have signed large-scale deals with AI programming companies to license their material to assist in the training of AI tools, particularly LLMs.\n[3]\nAs AI-driven applications continue to grow, publishers have a unique opportunity to license their valuable content to large language model (LLM) platforms such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and others. This partnership not only fuels technological innovation but also contributes to research, expands global reach, and creates new revenue streams. This article explores the benefits, procedures, challenges, and key considerations for publishers looking to engage with AI platform developers.\n[4]\nFor the time being, these recent rulings clarify that there are potentially lawful avenues for training LLMs using copyrighted materials. The legitimacy of the source of those copyrighted materials appears to be a factor upon which this analysis may turn, but it is unclear as yet what significance that factor may hold in the analysis. And continuing efforts to ensure the AI output is not infringing appear to be relevant. Businesses seeking to utilize large datasets for LLM training should prioritize comprehensive compliance strategies, including thorough vetting of all data sources to help minimize risk, and express policies and practices to mitigate the possibility of infringing output.\nBoth cases are continuing to be litigated as these respective orders did not resolve all issues before the courts.

We therefore remain in the early stages of this evolving legal issue.\n[7]\nPreventing rivals from replicating innovative technology without investing comparable resources is a common goal for many firms, but one that is only occasionally in the public interest; furthermore, the absence of training data transparency requirements could itself facilitate anti-competitive practices, such as by enabling the largest AI developers to enter into preferential licensing agreements with entities with access to large pools of training data.33 And while the proliferation of potentially dangerous AI technology is a valid concern, this argument could justify any measure aimed at hindering the market entry of competitors.\n[8]\nAdditionally, the AI Act acknowledges the importance of balancing copyright protection with the promotion of innovation and research. It introduces limited exceptions for text and data mining, recognizing the need for proportionality in compliance requirements, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), startups and non-profits. This provision aims to facilitate non-commercial research activities while ensuring that rightsholders\u2019 interests are adequately protected.\n[9]\nFor example, \u201c[p]remature adoption [of statutory, compulsory licenses] \u2026 risks stifling the development of flexible and creative market-based solutions\u2026and can take years to develop.\u201d Likewise, technological developments in AI may require fewer unlicensed works without sacrificing quality.

And now other publishers are getting in on the action, putting their money (and extensive archive of materials) where their mouth is to try and improve AI\u2019s potential in scholarly publishing. As AI use becomes more widespread, multiple publishers have signed large-scale deals with AI programming companies to license their material to assist in the training of AI tools, particularly LLMs.\n[3]\nAs AI-driven applications continue to grow, publishers have a unique opportunity to license their valuable content to large language model (LLM) platforms such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and others. This partnership not only fuels technological innovation but also contributes to research, expands global reach, and creates new revenue streams. This article explores the benefits, procedures, challenges, and key considerations for publishers looking to engage with AI platform developers.\n[4]\nFor the time being, these recent rulings clarify that there are potentially lawful avenues for training LLMs using copyrighted materials. The legitimacy of the source of those copyrighted materials appears to be a factor upon which this analysis may turn, but it is unclear as yet what significance that factor may hold in the analysis. And continuing efforts to ensure the AI output is not infringing appear to be relevant. Businesses seeking to utilize large datasets for LLM training should prioritize comprehensive compliance strategies, including thorough vetting of all data sources to help minimize risk, and express policies and practices to mitigate the possibility of infringing output.\nBoth cases are continuing to be litigated as these respective orders did not resolve all issues before the courts. As a result, more remains to be seen as these issues continue to develop. For the time being, these recent rulings clarify that there are potentially lawful avenues for training LLMs using copyrighted materials.\n[5]\nto limit copyright law liability should not be on the training \u00b7 of LLMs, but rather on the risks associated with output of ...

In response, hiQ sought an injunction and for a court to de-\n[6]\nWe can also expect that many plaintiffs will focus on evidence of indirect substitution to bolster their arguments of market harm when challenging defendants\u2019 fair use defense. Finally, as noted earlier, we strongly expect that these decisions and future ones on these issues will get appealed, with potential petitions to the Supreme Court for review. We therefore remain in the early stages of this evolving legal issue.\n[7]\nPreventing rivals from replicating innovative technology without investing comparable resources is a common goal for many firms, but one that is only occasionally in the public interest; furthermore, the absence of training data transparency requirements could itself facilitate anti-competitive practices, such as by enabling the largest AI developers to enter into preferential licensing agreements with entities with access to large pools of training data.33 And while the proliferation of potentially dangerous AI technology is a valid concern, this argument could justify any measure aimed at hindering the market entry of competitors.\n[8]\nAdditionally, the AI Act acknowledges the importance of balancing copyright protection with the promotion of innovation and research. It introduces limited exceptions for text and data mining, recognizing the need for proportionality in compliance requirements, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), startups and non-profits. This provision aims to facilitate non-commercial research activities while ensuring that rightsholders\u2019 interests are adequately protected.\n[9]\nFor example, \u201c[p]remature adoption [of statutory, compulsory licenses] \u2026 risks stifling the development of flexible and creative market-based solutions\u2026and can take years to develop.\u201d Likewise, technological developments in AI may require fewer unlicensed works without sacrificing quality. Although the report is preliminary and carries no legal effect on current or future litigation, the comprehensive analysis in the report provides ample support for those on both sides of the issue of whether training AI with copyrighted works constitutes copyright infringement or fair use.\n[10]\ncompliance with legal regimes.85 For example, Getty Images states that when it licenses works \u00b7 for use in a commercial text-to-image model, it \u201ccurates a dataset that includes content that has \u00b7 been released for commercial use in respect of rights of publicity, privacy, trademark, and other ... 79 See, e.g., BSA Initial Comments at 6 (\u201c\u2018Raw data\u2019 is frequently \u2018messy,\u2019 requiring significant work to transform the ... 80 DATASET PROVIDERS ALLIANCE, SHAPING THE FUTURE OF AI DATA (2024) (\u201cWhile some data types are abundant,\n[11]\nNegotiate data ownership and output rights before vendors access sensitive data: Once a vendor has trained on your data, it\u2019s difficult (and sometimes impossible) to claw back rights or confirm deletion.

What are the possible legal angles that publishers might take?\n\nThe draft page:\n# Background\n\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has precipitated a significant legal discourse surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for training generative AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs) [1]. These systems require substantial datasets, often comprising copyrighted texts, to generate new content such as books, artwork, music, or computer code [1]. This necessity has led to over 25 pending lawsuits involving allegations of copyright infringement by LLMs, highlighting the legal uncertainties and potential challenges for publishers and content creators [1].\nRecently, a federal court in California addressed these concerns by issuing decisions that delineate the boundaries of \"fair use\" concerning the use of copyrighted materials in training LLMs [1]. In Bartz v. Anthropic, the court found that training LLMs using copyrighted books represents a \"quintessentially transformative\" use under the Copyright Act, which is a pivotal development in the legal landscape for AI technologies [2]. This ruling provides critical guidance for companies developing or deploying generative AI systems, as well as for businesses dependent on AI vendors [2].\nThe legal discourse is further complicated by precedents set in other fair use cases. For instance, the court in Ringgold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc. found that the recognizability and detail of an artist's imagery could influence fair use determinations [3]. Such precedents indicate that fair use cases can vary significantly, often contradicting one another or conflicting with established rules [3]. Consequently, creators and users of copyrighted works must carefully consider whether their secondary use serves a distinct purpose from the original, as this is a crucial factor in fair use analyses [4].\nMoreover, the intersection of AI technology and copyright law is likely to remain contentious as stakeholders, including publishers, seek to navigate this evolving landscape. Artists and creators may perceive this as a murkier or riskier environment, necessitating a focus on legal strategies that emphasize the transformative nature and distinct purpose of AI-generated content [4].\n\n# Role of Court Presidents\n\nThe role of court presidents, particularly those presiding over cases involving the intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence (AI) training, is pivotal in shaping the legal landscape in this emerging area. Recent decisions by U.S. Federal District Court judges in the Northern District of California illustrate the judiciary's evolving approach to these complex issues. Judges like William Alsup and Vince Chhabria have recently issued summary judgment decisions that contribute to the framework for addressing the boundaries of fair use in the context of AI training with copyrighted materials[5]. These decisions are significant as they are among the first to explore whether using copyrighted works to train generative AI models, such as Meta's LLaMA models, constitutes \"fair use\" under U.S. law[6].\nCourt presidents in these cases are tasked with balancing the established four-factor test for fair use. This test considers the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the market value of the copyrighted work[7]. The interpretations and rulings of court presidents can set precedents that influence subsequent legal arguments and court decisions in similar cases. However, as noted in some rulings, the arguments made by the parties involved and the records developed can heavily impact the court's decisions, suggesting that the role of the court president is also contingent on the quality of advocacy presented[8].\nFurthermore, court presidents must navigate the overlap between copyright and patent jurisprudence, given their shared constitutional clause and justifications[9]. Their rulings, while not always definitive, contribute to the evolving jurisprudence concerning AI and copyright, offering guidance on how the principles of fair use might be applied to new technologies and creative works[9]. As AI systems become more prevalent, the decisions made by these judicial figures will continue to play a crucial role in defining the boundaries and implications of using copyrighted materials for AI training.\n\n# Controversies Surrounding AI Training\n\nThe use of copyrighted material in training datasets for artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked significant controversy and legal debates. One of the central issues is the potential loss of licensing opportunities for copyright holders, as AI companies often use copyrighted works without obtaining the necessary permissions or paying for licenses[10]. For instance, Getty Images has accused Stability AI of using its images for training without obtaining a license, highlighting a broader concern that copyright holders should have the right to participate in this emerging market[10].\nCopyright infringement is another critical aspect of the controversy. The unauthorized use of copyrighted works in AI training datasets may be deemed infringement, subject to legal penalties[11]. However, copyright infringement claims must typically be preceded by the registration of the work with the U.S. Copyright Office[12].\nThe fair use doctrine under U.S. copyright law provides a potential defense for AI companies accused of infringement[13]. This doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material for specific purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research[13]. Courts determine the applicability of fair use by evaluating four factors: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the original work, the amount used, and the effect on the market for the original work[13]. However, there is ongoing debate over whether AI training practices fall within the boundaries of fair use, especially when large amounts of copyrighted material are used to produce new expressive content[14][15]. Some argue that AI companies should not be exempt from liability when using copyrighted works without permission and compensation[15].\nRecent legal cases, such as Anthropic and Kadrey v. Meta, have begun to offer judicial guidance on how courts might apply the fair use doctrine to AI training practices[13]. In these cases, courts have dismissed some arguments regarding potential market harm as speculative, likening them to teaching children to write, which may result in more competing works[16]. Nonetheless, the boundaries of fair use in the context of AI remain a topic of active legal exploration and litigation[17].\nFor businesses and startups, the lesson is clear: using properly licensed training data is essential to avoid legal and reputational risks[17]. As AI technology continues to evolve, the legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training is likely to become increasingly defined, with more legal battles expected over issues of originality and ownership[17].\n\n# Legal Angles for Publishers\n\nPress publishers have a variety of legal angles they might pursue in the context of copyrighted material used for training large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI). One significant angle involves leveraging existing copyright laws to assert rights over the materials they publish. Publishers typically own copyrights in the compilations they produce, which grants them a layer of protection under U.S. copyright law[18]. Ensuring that authors do not incorporate third-party materials without permission is crucial, and publishers often collaborate with authors to preemptively address potential infringements[19].\nAnother legal strategy involves the exploration of licensing agreements, which serve as a practical solution for managing the use of copyrighted content in AI training. Licensing not only ensures fair compensation to rights holders but also helps maintain control over the use of copyrighted materials[20][21]. This can be achieved through direct licensing agreements or through collective licensing efforts, which have gained traction recently. Collective licensing allows for streamlined processes and ensures fair compensation, although scaling such frameworks to accommodate the vast array of works used in AI training poses a challenge[22][23].\nMoreover, developing tiered licensing structures tailored to different AI use cases can further protect data assets. This approach includes the use of technical safeguards and robust contractual terms to prevent unauthorized use[24]. Such licensing programs demand transparency from AI vendors about their copyright compliance efforts as part of indemnification negotiations[25].\nThe evolving nature of AI also raises questions about the adequacy of traditional intellectual property laws. Current legal frameworks struggle to keep pace with the unique challenges posed by AI-generated content, leaving uncertainties about how to protect, license, and enforce rights in these works[26][27]. Fair use doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material for purposes like criticism and news reporting, plays a role in these considerations. However, courts may be skeptical of claims that copying for AI training constitutes fair use, particularly when such activities have commercial implications[28][29].\nLastly, the emergence of AI as a collaborator in the creative process complicates the traditional understanding of authorship, a cornerstone of copyright and intellectual property law. Publishers may need to advocate for adaptations to these legal definitions to better accommodate AI's role in content creation[30].\n\n# Court Rulings and Interpretations\n\nRecent court rulings have begun to shape the legal landscape regarding the use of copyrighted materials in training large language models and other AI technologies. Notably, two summary judgment decisions by U.S. Federal District Court judges in the Northern District of California have established a preliminary framework for addressing these issues. Judge William Alsup, in Bartz et al. v. Anthropic PBC (June 23, 2025), and Judge Vince Chhabria, in Richard Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (June 25, 2025), have both contributed to the evolving jurisprudence at the intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence training[5].\nDespite siding with Meta Platforms, Inc., in a recent case, the court emphasized that the ruling was specific to the works included in the lawsuit and suggested that future plaintiffs could prevail if they present stronger arguments[31]. This indicates that the courts are open to refining their positions as new cases arise, potentially providing opportunities for copyright holders to succeed under different circumstances.\nThe courts have developed a set of criteria to evaluate fair use, which are instrumental in these rulings. These criteria include: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is commercial or educational; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use on the potential market or value of the copyrighted work[7]. Each of these criteria plays a crucial role in balancing the interests of technology companies and copyright holders, guiding judges and legal practitioners in navigating these complex cases.\nWhile the legal framework is still developing, these court rulings provide important insights into how future cases may be adjudicated. They help delineate the boundaries of fair use and offer a glimpse into the legal strategies that might be employed by publishers and other stakeholders as they seek to protect their intellectual property rights in the face of rapidly advancing AI technologies[32].\n\n# Strategies for Publishers\n\nIn the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, publishers have a unique opportunity to engage with AI platform developers to leverage their content effectively. Several strategies can be adopted to navigate the legal angles associated with using copyrighted material for training large language models (LLMs).\nOne primary strategy for publishers is to negotiate favorable licensing agreements with AI developers. These agreements should focus on correctly citing sources and licensing content for AI training to ensure compliance with copyright laws[33]. Publishers like Cambridge and Taylor & Francis are already working towards such agreements to license their material to assist in the training of AI tools[34].\nAnother strategy involves ensuring that the AI output does not infringe on copyright laws. This can be achieved by adopting comprehensive compliance strategies, including thorough vetting of all data sources and implementing policies to mitigate the risk of infringing output[35]. Publishers should prioritize these measures to avoid potential legal challenges.\nPublishers should also be aware of the market dynamics and the potential for anti-competitive practices. Without transparency in training data requirements, there is a risk of enabling the largest AI developers to enter into preferential licensing agreements, which could limit market competition[36]. To counter this, publishers can work towards creating more open and competitive frameworks that promote innovation while safeguarding their interests.\nFurthermore, the introduction of statutory licenses should be approached cautiously. Premature adoption of such licenses might stifle creative, market-based solutions and could take years to develop[37]. Therefore, publishers are encouraged to explore flexible and innovative licensing solutions that can adapt to technological advancements without hindering progress.\nFinally, in the context of evolving regulations like the EU AI Act, it is vital for publishers to align their agreements with these emerging legal frameworks. This includes addressing data ownership, refining datasets, and establishing output rights before engaging with AI developers. By doing so, publishers can maintain control over their content and avoid disputes in the future[38]. This proactive approach can help publishers maximize their benefits while minimizing legal risks in the AI-driven environment.\n\n# Responses from the Technology Sector\n\nThe technology sector has adopted various approaches in response to the controversy over the use of copyrighted material for training large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI). One significant response involves the exploration of technological solutions to address copyright concerns. AI companies are working on developing sophisticated methods to anonymize or transform training data, which could make it harder to reconstruct original works from the output generated by AI systems[39]. These methods aim to mitigate potential copyright infringement by ensuring that the output does not directly replicate copyrighted material.\nAdditionally, some companies are implementing filtering systems to prevent the output of copyrighted material, thereby reducing the risk of infringement[39]. Businesses utilizing large datasets for LLM training are advised to prioritize comprehensive compliance strategies. This includes thorough vetting of all data sources to minimize legal risks and adopting policies to mitigate the possibility of infringing outputs[35]. By doing so, companies can navigate the legal landscape and continue to innovate while respecting copyright laws.\nLegal considerations play a crucial role in shaping the responses of technology firms. The outcomes of ongoing litigation and the interpretation of fair use in relation to AI training will significantly influence the future of technology and creative industries[40]. If AI copying and processing are deemed to fall under fair use, technology companies may have more freedom in using copyrighted materials. Conversely, if they do not fall under this umbrella, companies will need to seek permission and potentially compensate rights holders, affecting how generative AI innovation progresses in the United States[40].\n\n# International Perspectives\n\nThe issue of using copyrighted materials for training large language models (LLMs) and AI has elicited varied responses across different jurisdictions, reflecting distinct legal traditions and policy priorities. In the United States, a significant ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June 2025 determined that the use of copyrighted works to train LLMs constitutes fair use under U.S. copyright law[41]. This decision aligns with the broader U.S. stance on extending copyright protection to works from countries that are parties to major international agreements like the TRIPS and the Berne Convention[42].\nIn contrast, the European Union (EU) has adopted a more stringent regulatory framework. While the EU permits text and data mining (TDM), it mandates that providers of general-purpose AI models comply with explicit legal obligations and respect any reservations made by copyright holders[40]. This includes substantial transparency requirements, such as publishing detailed summaries of the data used for training models. The EU is also urged to reassess its approach to better accommodate the evolving landscape of AI-generated creativity, ensuring a balanced protection of both human creators and technological innovations[30].\nMeanwhile, other countries have introduced exceptions to facilitate AI development. For instance, Japan's 2018 legislation permits the use of copyrighted materials for a broad spectrum of computing-related activities without requiring rightsholder permission[36]. Singapore has similarly introduced exceptions allowing copying for computational data analysis[36]. China, a major hub for AI development, and other jurisdictions have enacted open-ended copyright exceptions that could apply to AI model training, although the applicability varies[36].\nThese diverse international perspectives underscore the complexity of harmonizing copyright laws in the context of AI, as countries navigate the balance between fostering technological innovation and protecting the rights of content creators[39].\n\n# Case Studies\n\nThe legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted material in training language learning models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) is marked by ongoing and high-profile litigation. This section examines two significant cases that highlight the complexities of fair use in this context.\n\n## Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith\n\nIn one landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the case of Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, which revolved around photographs of the musician Prince taken by Goldsmith in 1981. Although Prince was not famous at the time, the images became widely recognized as he rose to stardom. This case sheds light on the broader implications of copyright infringement concerning fair use and transformative purpose, which are key factors in LLM training [43].\n\n## AIME et al. v. Regents of UCLA et al.\n\nAnother notable case is AIME et al. v. Regents of UCLA et al., where the Association for Information Media (AIME) and AVP, an educational video publisher, filed a lawsuit against UCLA for streaming videos for student use. This case illustrates the ongoing debate about the educational use of copyrighted materials and the boundaries of fair use. The decision here emphasizes the potential for lawful educational purposes in the digital era, highlighting the nuanced arguments that publishers might explore [44].\n\n## Legal Considerations and Future Directions\n\nThe courts often focus on the first and fourth factors of fair use, particularly whether the use is \"transformative\" and the impact on the market value of the original work. Recent rulings suggest that there are legal avenues available for training LLMs with copyrighted materials, but these are contingent upon the specific facts of each case. The notion of transformation remains pivotal, as evidenced by cases where judges deemed the copying of works for LLM training as transformative under the fair use doctrine. However, these decisions are not conclusive and may be subject to further appeal, signaling an evolving area of legal discourse [45][46].\nThe potential for appeals and further legal challenges indicates that the issues surrounding LLM training and copyright law are still in their formative stages. As such, developers and publishers alike must navigate this complex terrain with caution, ensuring that any copyrighted works used are legally obtained to mitigate risks [8][46].\n\n# Future Implications\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues to advance, particularly in the realm of large language models (LLMs), the legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training is poised for significant change. Courts are beginning to set boundaries for how creative works can be used to power new technology, providing a framework that evaluates the sourcing, use, and storage of copyrighted materials in AI development[2][17]. This evolving legal environment may encourage innovation by reinforcing the exclusive rights of creators through intellectual property laws, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, each safeguarding different aspects of intellectual creations[47].\nThe future strength of fair use defenses in AI development will depend heavily on how LLMs are trained and whether the data used in their training is legally obtained[48]. Developers and businesses must prioritize using properly licensed training data to avoid costly lawsuits and reputational damage, as reliance on pirated or unlicensed materials could lead to legal battles over content ownership[17]. This necessity for lawful data sourcing aligns with broader historical trends where technological advancements have challenged and expanded the scope of art and artmaking, though AI's potential encroachment on human creators presents a more contentious dynamic[49].\nFurther research is needed to assess how the value of human-authored works may be impacted by AI, and whether these impacts will lessen as the quality of AI-generated works improves[50]. As companies explore new business models, including licensing agreements and revenue-sharing models with artists, there is potential for innovative collaborations that could stimulate creative partnerships and growth within the industry[20]. However, as the legal framework catches up with AI technology, publishers and creators alike may need to navigate a complex landscape of legislative changes aimed at protecting both human and AI-generated intellectual property[51][52].\n\nWrite the lead section:", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Write a lead section for the given Wikipedia page with the following guidelines:\n    1.

What are the possible legal angles that publishers might take?\n\nThe draft page:\n# Background\n\nThe rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has precipitated a significant legal discourse surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for training generative AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs) [1]. These systems require substantial datasets, often comprising copyrighted texts, to generate new content such as books, artwork, music, or computer code [1]. This necessity has led to over 25 pending lawsuits involving allegations of copyright infringement by LLMs, highlighting the legal uncertainties and potential challenges for publishers and content creators [1].\nRecently, a federal court in California addressed these concerns by issuing decisions that delineate the boundaries of \"fair use\" concerning the use of copyrighted materials in training LLMs [1]. In Bartz v. Anthropic, the court found that training LLMs using copyrighted books represents a \"quintessentially transformative\" use under the Copyright Act, which is a pivotal development in the legal landscape for AI technologies [2]. This ruling provides critical guidance for companies developing or deploying generative AI systems, as well as for businesses dependent on AI vendors [2].\nThe legal discourse is further complicated by precedents set in other fair use cases. For instance, the court in Ringgold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc. found that the recognizability and detail of an artist's imagery could influence fair use determinations [3]. Such precedents indicate that fair use cases can vary significantly, often contradicting one another or conflicting with established rules [3]. Consequently, creators and users of copyrighted works must carefully consider whether their secondary use serves a distinct purpose from the original, as this is a crucial factor in fair use analyses [4].\nMoreover, the intersection of AI technology and copyright law is likely to remain contentious as stakeholders, including publishers, seek to navigate this evolving landscape. Artists and creators may perceive this as a murkier or riskier environment, necessitating a focus on legal strategies that emphasize the transformative nature and distinct purpose of AI-generated content [4].\n\n# Role of Court Presidents\n\nThe role of court presidents, particularly those presiding over cases involving the intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence (AI) training, is pivotal in shaping the legal landscape in this emerging area. Recent decisions by U.S. Federal District Court judges in the Northern District of California illustrate the judiciary's evolving approach to these complex issues. Judges like William Alsup and Vince Chhabria have recently issued summary judgment decisions that contribute to the framework for addressing the boundaries of fair use in the context of AI training with copyrighted materials[5]. These decisions are significant as they are among the first to explore whether using copyrighted works to train generative AI models, such as Meta's LLaMA models, constitutes \"fair use\" under U.S. law[6].\nCourt presidents in these cases are tasked with balancing the established four-factor test for fair use. This test considers the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the market value of the copyrighted work[7]. The interpretations and rulings of court presidents can set precedents that influence subsequent legal arguments and court decisions in similar cases. However, as noted in some rulings, the arguments made by the parties involved and the records developed can heavily impact the court's decisions, suggesting that the role of the court president is also contingent on the quality of advocacy presented[8].\nFurthermore, court presidents must navigate the overlap between copyright and patent jurisprudence, given their shared constitutional clause and justifications[9]. Their rulings, while not always definitive, contribute to the evolving jurisprudence concerning AI and copyright, offering guidance on how the principles of fair use might be applied to new technologies and creative works[9]. As AI systems become more prevalent, the decisions made by these judicial figures will continue to play a crucial role in defining the boundaries and implications of using copyrighted materials for AI training.\n\n# Controversies Surrounding AI Training\n\nThe use of copyrighted material in training datasets for artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked significant controversy and legal debates. One of the central issues is the potential loss of licensing opportunities for copyright holders, as AI companies often use copyrighted works without obtaining the necessary permissions or paying for licenses[10]. For instance, Getty Images has accused Stability AI of using its images for training without obtaining a license, highlighting a broader concern that copyright holders should have the right to participate in this emerging market[10].\nCopyright infringement is another critical aspect of the controversy. The unauthorized use of copyrighted works in AI training datasets may be deemed infringement, subject to legal penalties[11]. However, copyright infringement claims must typically be preceded by the registration of the work with the U.S. Copyright Office[12].\nThe fair use doctrine under U.S. copyright law provides a potential defense for AI companies accused of infringement[13]. This doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material for specific purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research[13]. Courts determine the applicability of fair use by evaluating four factors: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the original work, the amount used, and the effect on the market for the original work[13]. However, there is ongoing debate over whether AI training practices fall within the boundaries of fair use, especially when large amounts of copyrighted material are used to produce new expressive content[14][15]. Some argue that AI companies should not be exempt from liability when using copyrighted works without permission and compensation[15].\nRecent legal cases, such as Anthropic and Kadrey v. Meta, have begun to offer judicial guidance on how courts might apply the fair use doctrine to AI training practices[13]. In these cases, courts have dismissed some arguments regarding potential market harm as speculative, likening them to teaching children to write, which may result in more competing works[16]. Nonetheless, the boundaries of fair use in the context of AI remain a topic of active legal exploration and litigation[17].\nFor businesses and startups, the lesson is clear: using properly licensed training data is essential to avoid legal and reputational risks[17]. As AI technology continues to evolve, the legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training is likely to become increasingly defined, with more legal battles expected over issues of originality and ownership[17].\n\n# Legal Angles for Publishers\n\nPress publishers have a variety of legal angles they might pursue in the context of copyrighted material used for training large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI). One significant angle involves leveraging existing copyright laws to assert rights over the materials they publish. Publishers typically own copyrights in the compilations they produce, which grants them a layer of protection under U.S. copyright law[18]. Ensuring that authors do not incorporate third-party materials without permission is crucial, and publishers often collaborate with authors to preemptively address potential infringements[19].\nAnother legal strategy involves the exploration of licensing agreements, which serve as a practical solution for managing the use of copyrighted content in AI training. Licensing not only ensures fair compensation to rights holders but also helps maintain control over the use of copyrighted materials[20][21]. This can be achieved through direct licensing agreements or through collective licensing efforts, which have gained traction recently. Collective licensing allows for streamlined processes and ensures fair compensation, although scaling such frameworks to accommodate the vast array of works used in AI training poses a challenge[22][23].\nMoreover, developing tiered licensing structures tailored to different AI use cases can further protect data assets. This approach includes the use of technical safeguards and robust contractual terms to prevent unauthorized use[24]. Such licensing programs demand transparency from AI vendors about their copyright compliance efforts as part of indemnification negotiations[25].\nThe evolving nature of AI also raises questions about the adequacy of traditional intellectual property laws. Current legal frameworks struggle to keep pace with the unique challenges posed by AI-generated content, leaving uncertainties about how to protect, license, and enforce rights in these works[26][27]. Fair use doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material for purposes like criticism and news reporting, plays a role in these considerations. However, courts may be skeptical of claims that copying for AI training constitutes fair use, particularly when such activities have commercial implications[28][29].\nLastly, the emergence of AI as a collaborator in the creative process complicates the traditional understanding of authorship, a cornerstone of copyright and intellectual property law. Publishers may need to advocate for adaptations to these legal definitions to better accommodate AI's role in content creation[30].\n\n# Court Rulings and Interpretations\n\nRecent court rulings have begun to shape the legal landscape regarding the use of copyrighted materials in training large language models and other AI technologies. Notably, two summary judgment decisions by U.S. Federal District Court judges in the Northern District of California have established a preliminary framework for addressing these issues. Judge William Alsup, in Bartz et al. v. Anthropic PBC (June 23, 2025), and Judge Vince Chhabria, in Richard Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (June 25, 2025), have both contributed to the evolving jurisprudence at the intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence training[5].\nDespite siding with Meta Platforms, Inc., in a recent case, the court emphasized that the ruling was specific to the works included in the lawsuit and suggested that future plaintiffs could prevail if they present stronger arguments[31]. This indicates that the courts are open to refining their positions as new cases arise, potentially providing opportunities for copyright holders to succeed under different circumstances.\nThe courts have developed a set of criteria to evaluate fair use, which are instrumental in these rulings. These criteria include: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is commercial or educational; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use on the potential market or value of the copyrighted work[7]. Each of these criteria plays a crucial role in balancing the interests of technology companies and copyright holders, guiding judges and legal practitioners in navigating these complex cases.\nWhile the legal framework is still developing, these court rulings provide important insights into how future cases may be adjudicated. They help delineate the boundaries of fair use and offer a glimpse into the legal strategies that might be employed by publishers and other stakeholders as they seek to protect their intellectual property rights in the face of rapidly advancing AI technologies[32].\n\n# Strategies for Publishers\n\nIn the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, publishers have a unique opportunity to engage with AI platform developers to leverage their content effectively. Several strategies can be adopted to navigate the legal angles associated with using copyrighted material for training large language models (LLMs).\nOne primary strategy for publishers is to negotiate favorable licensing agreements with AI developers. These agreements should focus on correctly citing sources and licensing content for AI training to ensure compliance with copyright laws[33]. Publishers like Cambridge and Taylor & Francis are already working towards such agreements to license their material to assist in the training of AI tools[34].\nAnother strategy involves ensuring that the AI output does not infringe on copyright laws. This can be achieved by adopting comprehensive compliance strategies, including thorough vetting of all data sources and implementing policies to mitigate the risk of infringing output[35]. Publishers should prioritize these measures to avoid potential legal challenges.\nPublishers should also be aware of the market dynamics and the potential for anti-competitive practices. Without transparency in training data requirements, there is a risk of enabling the largest AI developers to enter into preferential licensing agreements, which could limit market competition[36]. To counter this, publishers can work towards creating more open and competitive frameworks that promote innovation while safeguarding their interests.\nFurthermore, the introduction of statutory licenses should be approached cautiously. Premature adoption of such licenses might stifle creative, market-based solutions and could take years to develop[37]. Therefore, publishers are encouraged to explore flexible and innovative licensing solutions that can adapt to technological advancements without hindering progress.\nFinally, in the context of evolving regulations like the EU AI Act, it is vital for publishers to align their agreements with these emerging legal frameworks. This includes addressing data ownership, refining datasets, and establishing output rights before engaging with AI developers. By doing so, publishers can maintain control over their content and avoid disputes in the future[38]. This proactive approach can help publishers maximize their benefits while minimizing legal risks in the AI-driven environment.\n\n# Responses from the Technology Sector\n\nThe technology sector has adopted various approaches in response to the controversy over the use of copyrighted material for training large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI). One significant response involves the exploration of technological solutions to address copyright concerns. AI companies are working on developing sophisticated methods to anonymize or transform training data, which could make it harder to reconstruct original works from the output generated by AI systems[39]. These methods aim to mitigate potential copyright infringement by ensuring that the output does not directly replicate copyrighted material.\nAdditionally, some companies are implementing filtering systems to prevent the output of copyrighted material, thereby reducing the risk of infringement[39]. Businesses utilizing large datasets for LLM training are advised to prioritize comprehensive compliance strategies. This includes thorough vetting of all data sources to minimize legal risks and adopting policies to mitigate the possibility of infringing outputs[35]. By doing so, companies can navigate the legal landscape and continue to innovate while respecting copyright laws.\nLegal considerations play a crucial role in shaping the responses of technology firms. The outcomes of ongoing litigation and the interpretation of fair use in relation to AI training will significantly influence the future of technology and creative industries[40]. If AI copying and processing are deemed to fall under fair use, technology companies may have more freedom in using copyrighted materials. Conversely, if they do not fall under this umbrella, companies will need to seek permission and potentially compensate rights holders, affecting how generative AI innovation progresses in the United States[40].\n\n# International Perspectives\n\nThe issue of using copyrighted materials for training large language models (LLMs) and AI has elicited varied responses across different jurisdictions, reflecting distinct legal traditions and policy priorities. In the United States, a significant ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June 2025 determined that the use of copyrighted works to train LLMs constitutes fair use under U.S. copyright law[41]. This decision aligns with the broader U.S. stance on extending copyright protection to works from countries that are parties to major international agreements like the TRIPS and the Berne Convention[42].\nIn contrast, the European Union (EU) has adopted a more stringent regulatory framework. While the EU permits text and data mining (TDM), it mandates that providers of general-purpose AI models comply with explicit legal obligations and respect any reservations made by copyright holders[40]. This includes substantial transparency requirements, such as publishing detailed summaries of the data used for training models. The EU is also urged to reassess its approach to better accommodate the evolving landscape of AI-generated creativity, ensuring a balanced protection of both human creators and technological innovations[30].\nMeanwhile, other countries have introduced exceptions to facilitate AI development. For instance, Japan's 2018 legislation permits the use of copyrighted materials for a broad spectrum of computing-related activities without requiring rightsholder permission[36]. Singapore has similarly introduced exceptions allowing copying for computational data analysis[36]. China, a major hub for AI development, and other jurisdictions have enacted open-ended copyright exceptions that could apply to AI model training, although the applicability varies[36].\nThese diverse international perspectives underscore the complexity of harmonizing copyright laws in the context of AI, as countries navigate the balance between fostering technological innovation and protecting the rights of content creators[39].\n\n# Case Studies\n\nThe legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted material in training language learning models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) is marked by ongoing and high-profile litigation. This section examines two significant cases that highlight the complexities of fair use in this context.\n\n## Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith\n\nIn one landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the case of Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, which revolved around photographs of the musician Prince taken by Goldsmith in 1981. Although Prince was not famous at the time, the images became widely recognized as he rose to stardom. This case sheds light on the broader implications of copyright infringement concerning fair use and transformative purpose, which are key factors in LLM training [43].\n\n## AIME et al. v. Regents of UCLA et al.\n\nAnother notable case is AIME et al. v. Regents of UCLA et al., where the Association for Information Media (AIME) and AVP, an educational video publisher, filed a lawsuit against UCLA for streaming videos for student use. This case illustrates the ongoing debate about the educational use of copyrighted materials and the boundaries of fair use. The decision here emphasizes the potential for lawful educational purposes in the digital era, highlighting the nuanced arguments that publishers might explore [44].\n\n## Legal Considerations and Future Directions\n\nThe courts often focus on the first and fourth factors of fair use, particularly whether the use is \"transformative\" and the impact on the market value of the original work.
