As AI continues to evolve, the interplay between copyright law and AI training practices will remain a contentious and dynamic field, with ongoing legal exploration and adaptation necessary to address the challenges posed by these transformative technologies.

# Background

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has precipitated a significant legal discourse surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for training generative AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs) [1]. These systems require substantial datasets, often comprising copyrighted texts, to generate new content such as books, artwork, music, or computer code [1]. This necessity has led to over 25 pending lawsuits involving allegations of copyright infringement by LLMs, highlighting the legal uncertainties and potential challenges for publishers and content creators [1].
Recently, a federal court in California addressed these concerns by issuing decisions that delineate the boundaries of "fair use" concerning the use of copyrighted materials in training LLMs [1]. In Bartz v. Anthropic, the court found that training LLMs using copyrighted books represents a "quintessentially transformative" use under the Copyright Act, which is a pivotal development in the legal landscape for AI technologies [2]. This ruling provides critical guidance for companies developing or deploying generative AI systems, as well as for businesses dependent on AI vendors [2].
The legal discourse is further complicated by precedents set in other fair use cases. For instance, the court in Ringgold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc. found that the recognizability and detail of an artist's imagery could influence fair use determinations [3]. Such precedents indicate that fair use cases can vary significantly, often contradicting one another or conflicting with established rules [3]. Consequently, creators and users of copyrighted works must carefully consider whether their secondary use serves a distinct purpose from the original, as this is a crucial factor in fair use analyses [4].
Moreover, the intersection of AI technology and copyright law is likely to remain contentious as stakeholders, including publishers, seek to navigate this evolving landscape. Artists and creators may perceive this as a murkier or riskier environment, necessitating a focus on legal strategies that emphasize the transformative nature and distinct purpose of AI-generated content [4].

# Role of Court Presidents

The role of court presidents, particularly those presiding over cases involving the intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence (AI) training, is pivotal in shaping the legal landscape in this emerging area. Recent decisions by U.S. Federal District Court judges in the Northern District of California illustrate the judiciary's evolving approach to these complex issues. Judges like William Alsup and Vince Chhabria have recently issued summary judgment decisions that contribute to the framework for addressing the boundaries of fair use in the context of AI training with copyrighted materials[5]. These decisions are significant as they are among the first to explore whether using copyrighted works to train generative AI models, such as Meta's LLaMA models, constitutes "fair use" under U.S. law[6].
Court presidents in these cases are tasked with balancing the established four-factor test for fair use. This test considers the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the market value of the copyrighted work[7]. The interpretations and rulings of court presidents can set precedents that influence subsequent legal arguments and court decisions in similar cases. However, as noted in some rulings, the arguments made by the parties involved and the records developed can heavily impact the court's decisions, suggesting that the role of the court president is also contingent on the quality of advocacy presented[8].
Furthermore, court presidents must navigate the overlap between copyright and patent jurisprudence, given their shared constitutional clause and justifications[9]. Their rulings, while not always definitive, contribute to the evolving jurisprudence concerning AI and copyright, offering guidance on how the principles of fair use might be applied to new technologies and creative works[9]. As AI systems become more prevalent, the decisions made by these judicial figures will continue to play a crucial role in defining the boundaries and implications of using copyrighted materials for AI training.

# Controversies Surrounding AI Training

The use of copyrighted material in training datasets for artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked significant controversy and legal debates. One of the central issues is the potential loss of licensing opportunities for copyright holders, as AI companies often use copyrighted works without obtaining the necessary permissions or paying for licenses[10]. For instance, Getty Images has accused Stability AI of using its images for training without obtaining a license, highlighting a broader concern that copyright holders should have the right to participate in this emerging market[10].
Copyright infringement is another critical aspect of the controversy. The unauthorized use of copyrighted works in AI training datasets may be deemed infringement, subject to legal penalties[11]. However, copyright infringement claims must typically be preceded by the registration of the work with the U.S. Copyright Office[12].
The fair use doctrine under U.S. copyright law provides a potential defense for AI companies accused of infringement[13]. This doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material for specific purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research[13]. Courts determine the applicability of fair use by evaluating four factors: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the original work, the amount used, and the effect on the market for the original work[13]. However, there is ongoing debate over whether AI training practices fall within the boundaries of fair use, especially when large amounts of copyrighted material are used to produce new expressive content[14][15]. Some argue that AI companies should not be exempt from liability when using copyrighted works without permission and compensation[15].
Recent legal cases, such as Anthropic and Kadrey v. Meta, have begun to offer judicial guidance on how courts might apply the fair use doctrine to AI training practices[13]. In these cases, courts have dismissed some arguments regarding potential market harm as speculative, likening them to teaching children to write, which may result in more competing works[16]. Nonetheless, the boundaries of fair use in the context of AI remain a topic of active legal exploration and litigation[17].
For businesses and startups, the lesson is clear: using properly licensed training data is essential to avoid legal and reputational risks[17]. As AI technology continues to evolve, the legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training is likely to become increasingly defined, with more legal battles expected over issues of originality and ownership[17].

# Legal Angles for Publishers

Press publishers have a variety of legal angles they might pursue in the context of copyrighted material used for training large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI). One significant angle involves leveraging existing copyright laws to assert rights over the materials they publish. Publishers typically own copyrights in the compilations they produce, which grants them a layer of protection under U.S. copyright law[18]. Ensuring that authors do not incorporate third-party materials without permission is crucial, and publishers often collaborate with authors to preemptively address potential infringements[19].
Another legal strategy involves the exploration of licensing agreements, which serve as a practical solution for managing the use of copyrighted content in AI training. Licensing not only ensures fair compensation to rights holders but also helps maintain control over the use of copyrighted materials[20][21]. This can be achieved through direct licensing agreements or through collective licensing efforts, which have gained traction recently. Collective licensing allows for streamlined processes and ensures fair compensation, although scaling such frameworks to accommodate the vast array of works used in AI training poses a challenge[22][23].
Moreover, developing tiered licensing structures tailored to different AI use cases can further protect data assets. This approach includes the use of technical safeguards and robust contractual terms to prevent unauthorized use[24]. Such licensing programs demand transparency from AI vendors about their copyright compliance efforts as part of indemnification negotiations[25].
The evolving nature of AI also raises questions about the adequacy of traditional intellectual property laws. Current legal frameworks struggle to keep pace with the unique challenges posed by AI-generated content, leaving uncertainties about how to protect, license, and enforce rights in these works[26][27]. Fair use doctrine, which permits limited use of copyrighted material for purposes like criticism and news reporting, plays a role in these considerations. However, courts may be skeptical of claims that copying for AI training constitutes fair use, particularly when such activities have commercial implications[28][29].
Lastly, the emergence of AI as a collaborator in the creative process complicates the traditional understanding of authorship, a cornerstone of copyright and intellectual property law. Publishers may need to advocate for adaptations to these legal definitions to better accommodate AI's role in content creation[30].

# Court Rulings and Interpretations

Recent court rulings have begun to shape the legal landscape regarding the use of copyrighted materials in training large language models and other AI technologies. Notably, two summary judgment decisions by U.S. Federal District Court judges in the Northern District of California have established a preliminary framework for addressing these issues. Judge William Alsup, in Bartz et al. v. Anthropic PBC (June 23, 2025), and Judge Vince Chhabria, in Richard Kadrey et al. v. Meta Platforms, Inc. (June 25, 2025), have both contributed to the evolving jurisprudence at the intersection of copyright law and artificial intelligence training[5].
Despite siding with Meta Platforms, Inc., in a recent case, the court emphasized that the ruling was specific to the works included in the lawsuit and suggested that future plaintiffs could prevail if they present stronger arguments[31]. This indicates that the courts are open to refining their positions as new cases arise, potentially providing opportunities for copyright holders to succeed under different circumstances.
The courts have developed a set of criteria to evaluate fair use, which are instrumental in these rulings. These criteria include: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is commercial or educational; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use on the potential market or value of the copyrighted work[7]. Each of these criteria plays a crucial role in balancing the interests of technology companies and copyright holders, guiding judges and legal practitioners in navigating these complex cases.
While the legal framework is still developing, these court rulings provide important insights into how future cases may be adjudicated. They help delineate the boundaries of fair use and offer a glimpse into the legal strategies that might be employed by publishers and other stakeholders as they seek to protect their intellectual property rights in the face of rapidly advancing AI technologies[32].

# Strategies for Publishers

In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, publishers have a unique opportunity to engage with AI platform developers to leverage their content effectively. Several strategies can be adopted to navigate the legal angles associated with using copyrighted material for training large language models (LLMs).
One primary strategy for publishers is to negotiate favorable licensing agreements with AI developers. These agreements should focus on correctly citing sources and licensing content for AI training to ensure compliance with copyright laws[33]. Publishers like Cambridge and Taylor & Francis are already working towards such agreements to license their material to assist in the training of AI tools[34].
Another strategy involves ensuring that the AI output does not infringe on copyright laws. This can be achieved by adopting comprehensive compliance strategies, including thorough vetting of all data sources and implementing policies to mitigate the risk of infringing output[35]. Publishers should prioritize these measures to avoid potential legal challenges.
Publishers should also be aware of the market dynamics and the potential for anti-competitive practices. Without transparency in training data requirements, there is a risk of enabling the largest AI developers to enter into preferential licensing agreements, which could limit market competition[36]. To counter this, publishers can work towards creating more open and competitive frameworks that promote innovation while safeguarding their interests.
Furthermore, the introduction of statutory licenses should be approached cautiously. Premature adoption of such licenses might stifle creative, market-based solutions and could take years to develop[37]. Therefore, publishers are encouraged to explore flexible and innovative licensing solutions that can adapt to technological advancements without hindering progress.
Finally, in the context of evolving regulations like the EU AI Act, it is vital for publishers to align their agreements with these emerging legal frameworks. This includes addressing data ownership, refining datasets, and establishing output rights before engaging with AI developers. By doing so, publishers can maintain control over their content and avoid disputes in the future[38]. This proactive approach can help publishers maximize their benefits while minimizing legal risks in the AI-driven environment.

# Responses from the Technology Sector

The technology sector has adopted various approaches in response to the controversy over the use of copyrighted material for training large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI). One significant response involves the exploration of technological solutions to address copyright concerns. AI companies are working on developing sophisticated methods to anonymize or transform training data, which could make it harder to reconstruct original works from the output generated by AI systems[39]. These methods aim to mitigate potential copyright infringement by ensuring that the output does not directly replicate copyrighted material.
Additionally, some companies are implementing filtering systems to prevent the output of copyrighted material, thereby reducing the risk of infringement[39]. Businesses utilizing large datasets for LLM training are advised to prioritize comprehensive compliance strategies. This includes thorough vetting of all data sources to minimize legal risks and adopting policies to mitigate the possibility of infringing outputs[35]. By doing so, companies can navigate the legal landscape and continue to innovate while respecting copyright laws.
Legal considerations play a crucial role in shaping the responses of technology firms. The outcomes of ongoing litigation and the interpretation of fair use in relation to AI training will significantly influence the future of technology and creative industries[40]. If AI copying and processing are deemed to fall under fair use, technology companies may have more freedom in using copyrighted materials. Conversely, if they do not fall under this umbrella, companies will need to seek permission and potentially compensate rights holders, affecting how generative AI innovation progresses in the United States[40].

# International Perspectives

The issue of using copyrighted materials for training large language models (LLMs) and AI has elicited varied responses across different jurisdictions, reflecting distinct legal traditions and policy priorities. In the United States, a significant ruling by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June 2025 determined that the use of copyrighted works to train LLMs constitutes fair use under U.S. copyright law[41]. This decision aligns with the broader U.S. stance on extending copyright protection to works from countries that are parties to major international agreements like the TRIPS and the Berne Convention[42].
In contrast, the European Union (EU) has adopted a more stringent regulatory framework. While the EU permits text and data mining (TDM), it mandates that providers of general-purpose AI models comply with explicit legal obligations and respect any reservations made by copyright holders[40]. This includes substantial transparency requirements, such as publishing detailed summaries of the data used for training models. The EU is also urged to reassess its approach to better accommodate the evolving landscape of AI-generated creativity, ensuring a balanced protection of both human creators and technological innovations[30].
Meanwhile, other countries have introduced exceptions to facilitate AI development. For instance, Japan's 2018 legislation permits the use of copyrighted materials for a broad spectrum of computing-related activities without requiring rightsholder permission[36]. Singapore has similarly introduced exceptions allowing copying for computational data analysis[36]. China, a major hub for AI development, and other jurisdictions have enacted open-ended copyright exceptions that could apply to AI model training, although the applicability varies[36].
These diverse international perspectives underscore the complexity of harmonizing copyright laws in the context of AI, as countries navigate the balance between fostering technological innovation and protecting the rights of content creators[39].

# Case Studies

The legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted material in training language learning models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) is marked by ongoing and high-profile litigation. This section examines two significant cases that highlight the complexities of fair use in this context.

## Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith

In one landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the case of Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, Inc. v. Goldsmith, which revolved around photographs of the musician Prince taken by Goldsmith in 1981. Although Prince was not famous at the time, the images became widely recognized as he rose to stardom. This case sheds light on the broader implications of copyright infringement concerning fair use and transformative purpose, which are key factors in LLM training [43].

## AIME et al. v. Regents of UCLA et al.

Another notable case is AIME et al. v. Regents of UCLA et al., where the Association for Information Media (AIME) and AVP, an educational video publisher, filed a lawsuit against UCLA for streaming videos for student use. This case illustrates the ongoing debate about the educational use of copyrighted materials and the boundaries of fair use. The decision here emphasizes the potential for lawful educational purposes in the digital era, highlighting the nuanced arguments that publishers might explore [44].

## Legal Considerations and Future Directions

The courts often focus on the first and fourth factors of fair use, particularly whether the use is "transformative" and the impact on the market value of the original work. Recent rulings suggest that there are legal avenues available for training LLMs with copyrighted materials, but these are contingent upon the specific facts of each case. The notion of transformation remains pivotal, as evidenced by cases where judges deemed the copying of works for LLM training as transformative under the fair use doctrine. However, these decisions are not conclusive and may be subject to further appeal, signaling an evolving area of legal discourse [45][46].
The potential for appeals and further legal challenges indicates that the issues surrounding LLM training and copyright law are still in their formative stages. As such, developers and publishers alike must navigate this complex terrain with caution, ensuring that any copyrighted works used are legally obtained to mitigate risks [8][46].

# Future Implications

As artificial intelligence continues to advance, particularly in the realm of large language models (LLMs), the legal landscape surrounding the use of copyrighted materials for AI training is poised for significant change. Courts are beginning to set boundaries for how creative works can be used to power new technology, providing a framework that evaluates the sourcing, use, and storage of copyrighted materials in AI development[2][17]. This evolving legal environment may encourage innovation by reinforcing the exclusive rights of creators through intellectual property laws, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, each safeguarding different aspects of intellectual creations[47].
The future strength of fair use defenses in AI development will depend heavily on how LLMs are trained and whether the data used in their training is legally obtained[48]. Developers and businesses must prioritize using properly licensed training data to avoid costly lawsuits and reputational damage, as reliance on pirated or unlicensed materials could lead to legal battles over content ownership[17]. This necessity for lawful data sourcing aligns with broader historical trends where technological advancements have challenged and expanded the scope of art and artmaking, though AI's potential encroachment on human creators presents a more contentious dynamic[49].
Further research is needed to assess how the value of human-authored works may be impacted by AI, and whether these impacts will lessen as the quality of AI-generated works improves[50]. As companies explore new business models, including licensing agreements and revenue-sharing models with artists, there is potential for innovative collaborations that could stimulate creative partnerships and growth within the industry[20]. However, as the legal framework catches up with AI technology, publishers and creators alike may need to navigate a complex landscape of legislative changes aimed at protecting both human and AI-generated intellectual property[51][52].
