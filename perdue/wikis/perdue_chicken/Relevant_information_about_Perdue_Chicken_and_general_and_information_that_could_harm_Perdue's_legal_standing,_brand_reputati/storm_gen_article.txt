# History

Perdue Chicken, a notable name in the poultry industry, traces its origins back to 1920 when Arthur Perdue and his wife, Pearl, began selling eggs from a small flock of chickens housed in their backyard in Salisbury, Maryland[1]. The business initially focused on egg production, but by 1925, Arthur expanded operations by building the company's first hatchery and began selling layer chicks to farmers[1]. This shift marked the beginning of the company’s venture into chicken production, which would later become a significant part of its business model.
In the subsequent decades, Perdue adopted the principles of honesty, integrity, and quality as its core business philosophy, a legacy attributed to its founder, Arthur Perdue[2]. As the company evolved, it embraced vertical integration—a process wherein a company controls multiple stages of production and distribution—to increase its power and efficiency in the marketplace[2]. In 1958, Perdue made a pivotal move by constructing its own feed mill in Salisbury, further cementing its path toward vertical integration and growth[2].
Under the leadership of Arthur's son, Frank Perdue, the company experienced significant expansion and innovation. Frank Perdue was recognized for his commitment to innovation with several accolades, including the Edison Achievement Award in 1991[3]. This period also saw the establishment of Perdue as a branded product, which contributed to the company's growing reputation and market presence[4].
Over the years, Perdue has continued to innovate and adapt to changes in the industry. The company has implemented new standards for animal care, transparency initiatives, and enhanced the role of contract farmers, all aimed at improving its practices and sustaining growth[5]. Today, under the guidance of current leadership, Perdue leverages modern science and technology to continue the legacy of Arthur Perdue while adapting to contemporary challenges and opportunities in the poultry industry[6].

# Products

Perdue Chicken offers a diverse range of poultry products that cater to various consumer needs. The company has gained recognition for its premium brands, particularly those featuring no-antibiotics-ever chicken, turkey, pork, beef, and lamb, as well as USDA-certified organic chicken and beef[7]. Perdue's commitment to quality is further reflected in its premium product lines, which include heritage-breed, pastured, and grass-fed options[7].
Innovation is a key component of Perdue's product strategy. In late 2019, the company acquired Maxi Canada, a frozen nugget manufacturer, which expanded its product offerings to include items that combine chicken and vegetables[8]. This acquisition, along with ongoing innovations within its product lines, has enabled Perdue to maintain a significant presence in the premium products market, differentiating itself from competitors that predominantly offer mainstream, mass-produced items[8].
Perdue is also committed to ensuring the safety and quality of its products. The company recently recalled affected products produced during a particular production run as a precautionary measure to maintain its high standards of quality[9]. This decision underscores Perdue's dedication to consumer safety and satisfaction.
Additionally, Perdue continues to support sustainable agricultural practices and family farms. By creating new markets and supporting organic production, Perdue has bolstered the sustainability of conventional agriculture, further aligning with its values of quality and care[7].

# Production Process

Perdue Farms operates a vertically integrated production process, ensuring control and quality at every stage from egg and feed to market[10]. The company contracts with local farmers to raise chickens, supplying them with birds for processing. This approach has enabled Perdue to maintain quality control and improve profitability by eliminating intermediaries[10].
In recent years, Perdue has invested in innovative processing technologies to enhance efficiency and animal welfare. A significant advancement in their production process is the implementation of Controlled Atmosphere Stunning (CAS) systems. The CAS system, which was first operational in Milford, Delaware, in late 2019, minimizes handling stress for both chickens and workers by rendering birds unconscious with minimal trauma using a multi-stage, dual-gas technology[11][12][13]. Over several years, Perdue plans to convert all its processing plants to CAS systems, continuing with an installation in Dillon, South Carolina, in 2024[11][13].
Perdue has also been at the forefront of adopting practices that align with rising consumer demands for humane slaughterhouse practices. This initiative was developed with input from organizations such as Compassion in World Farming, Mercy for Animals, and the Humane Society of the United States, drawing inspiration from smaller organic companies acquired by Perdue[14].
Furthermore, Perdue Farms operates grain receiving and storage facilities and Maryland's first soybean processing plant, adding another layer of integration to their operations[10]. The company continues to collaborate with the Maryland Department of Environment to address potential environmental concerns related to its facilities[15].

# Sustainability and Animal Welfare

Perdue Farms has increasingly focused on sustainability and animal welfare as part of its corporate responsibility and public relations strategy. The company has committed to meeting the "2024" animal welfare criteria as outlined in the "Joint Animal Protection Agency Statement on Broiler Chicken Welfare Issues" and by the Global Animal Partnership. This includes offering slower-growing breeds that have higher welfare outcomes, reducing stocking density, and providing enhanced housing environments with brighter light, improved litter conditions, and enrichments that encourage normal behaviors. Additionally, Perdue is transitioning from electrical stunning to controlled atmosphere stunning and is demonstrating compliance through third-party verification[16].
Despite these commitments, the effectiveness and authenticity of Perdue's animal welfare initiatives have been questioned. While the company promotes transparency and positions its efforts as a victory for animal welfare, critics argue that these changes provide marginal gains for the lives of chickens and primarily serve as a form of publicity[17]. Consumer concerns over the treatment of animals have been steadily increasing, with a significant percentage of consumers paying attention to food labeling claims regarding how animals are raised[18].
Perdue's animal welfare initiatives also include a collaborative approach to animal care, guided by a team of veterinarians, animal welfare professionals, and input from third-party experts. The company provides training for all associates handling live animals and mandates the reporting of any violations of its animal welfare policies[19]. Moreover, Perdue has pledged to improve conditions not only for chickens but also for humans involved in its supply chain, focusing on the wants and needs of animals, improving relations with farmers, being open to criticism, and advancing knowledge about animal care[20]. Nonetheless, there is ongoing skepticism about whether corporations will honor their commitments fully[21].

# Corporate Structure

Perdue Farms is a significant player in the poultry industry and operates under a corporate structure that has seen multiple generations of leadership from the Perdue family. Dr. James A. Perdue currently serves as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, guiding the company into its second century of ownership by adhering to the foundational values established by his grandfather and father[22][23]. The leadership has consistently prioritized a people-first approach over the years, integrating consumer and stakeholder feedback into their strategic decisions[24][23].
The company has implemented several initiatives aimed at improving transparency and accountability within its operations. These initiatives include setting new standards for how birds are raised and slaughtered, enhancing the voice of contract farmers, and creating an animal care culture by establishing new executive positions focused on animal welfare[5]. Additionally, Perdue Farms has become a leader in the industry by eliminating the routine use of antibiotics in its chicken products, positioning itself as the top producer of USDA-certified chicken[23].
Despite these efforts, Perdue Farms has faced legal challenges that have brought scrutiny to its corporate practices. Notably, a class-action lawsuit was filed by the Humane Society of the United States against Perdue, alleging false advertising practices regarding the labeling of its chicken products as "humanely raised"[25]. This legal dispute highlights ongoing concerns about the alignment between the company's marketing strategies and its operational practices[26][25].

# Marketing and Branding

Perdue Chicken's marketing and branding strategies have played a significant role in establishing the company as a nationally recognized brand. The transformation began in the early 1970s when Perdue decided to launch a national advertising campaign. This move was crucial in promoting the brand and differentiating its products from competitors. Perdue personally appeared in over 200 advertisements from 1971 to 1994, utilizing his unique appearance to create a memorable and relatable brand persona that resonated with consumers[27][28].
The company has continuously evolved its branding efforts to align with consumer values and expectations. Recent packaging updates feature playful illustrations and vibrant colors, emphasizing trusted product attributes such as "no-antibiotics-ever," a 100-percent vegetarian diet, cage-free raising, and the absence of hormones or steroids. This rebrand, which is only the fourth major packaging update in Perdue's history, was informed by a comprehensive consumer survey indicating that the packaging was not misleading[29]. However, legal challenges have arisen, alleging that certain imagery, such as chickens roaming freely outdoors, inaccurately represent the conditions on Perdue's farms[29].
Perdue's branding emphasizes the concepts of freshness and safety, aligning with consumer preferences for quality and reliability[30]. The company's commitment to sustainability further reinforces its brand image. Perdue has increased support for family farms, expanded organic production, and developed products and services to enhance the sustainability of conventional agriculture[7].
Transparency and consumer trust remain vital components of Perdue's brand strategy. The company stresses the importance of third-party verification for its claims to ensure complete trust and transparency. Moreover, it encourages consumers to verify information from credible sources to maintain trust and mitigate the impact of unfounded rumors[31][32].

# Legal and Ethical Issues

Perdue Farms has been involved in several legal and ethical controversies that have drawn significant attention and criticism. A prominent legal issue is related to the use of misleading labels on their products. The lawsuit filed against Perdue alleges that the company falsely markets its poultry as "Humanely Raised" when the animals are actually kept indoors throughout their lives. This practice misleads consumers into believing they are purchasing products that align with higher animal welfare standards, which many are willing to pay a premium for[18][29]. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service has also been criticized for not adequately considering the imagery used on packaging, which further contributes to consumer deception[29].
In addition to labeling issues, Perdue has faced antitrust litigation related to price-fixing allegations. The company was part of a broader legal case involving several poultry producers accused of conspiring to manipulate the prices of broilers in the United States. This alleged conspiracy involved coordinating supply restrictions and sharing competitively sensitive information[33]. The litigation has resulted in settlements, with Perdue and other companies agreeing to substantial payments to resolve these claims[33].
Perdue has also been implicated in legal actions regarding labor practices. A lawsuit claimed that the company, alongside others, suppressed employee wages, which affected a large number of poultry processing line workers. These workers reportedly received wages near or below the poverty line, and the companies involved allegedly targeted vulnerable populations, such as migrants and refugees, for their workforce[34][35]. The case resulted in a collective settlement agreement to address these wage suppression allegations, totaling over $398 million across various defendants[36].

# Community and Philanthropy

Perdue Chicken has demonstrated a commitment to community engagement and philanthropy through various initiatives and contributions. The Perdue Foundation, an integral part of the company's community involvement efforts, recently donated $20,000 to support the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay watershed, showcasing their dedication to environmental stewardship[4]. Additionally, the foundation has invested in educational initiatives, such as funding an early learning center in Berlin, Maryland, to bolster local educational infrastructure[4].
In support of social welfare, Perdue has been actively involved with the United Way of the Lower Eastern Shore. The company, with the assistance of its associates, presented a record amount of funding to the organization, reflecting its commitment to improving the well-being of communities where it operates[4]. This ongoing engagement with local non-profit agencies is indicative of Perdue's broader strategy to foster good community relations and enhance its corporate social responsibility profile[37].
Beyond financial contributions, Perdue is involved in initiatives that promote animal welfare and environmental sustainability. The company collaborates with organizations like Compassion in World Farming, Mercy for Animals, and the Humane Society of the United States, drawing inspiration from smaller organic companies it has acquired to improve slaughterhouse practices in response to rising consumer demand for better animal welfare standards[14].
Through these diverse efforts, Perdue aims to create a positive impact on both local communities and broader environmental and animal welfare issues, balancing its corporate objectives with social and ecological responsibilities.

# Criticisms and Challenges

Perdue Farms has faced a range of criticisms and challenges in recent years, particularly concerning animal welfare, environmental issues, and labor practices.

## Labor Practices

The Department of Labor found that Perdue, along with SMX, employed children in hazardous conditions at its Accomac plant, dating back to 2020[38]. As a result, the company agreed not to hire anyone under 18 in certain locations and to implement mandatory training on child labor laws, as well as establish tip lines for reporting compliance issues[39]. This situation drew attention to broader concerns about labor practices within the company and the meatpacking industry as a whole.

## Animal Welfare Concerns

Perdue has been accused of misleading consumers about the treatment and living conditions of chickens and turkeys used for their products. The Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF) has criticized the company for its alleged role in allowing misleading labels, which impede efforts to address the inhumane, large-scale confinement of birds[29]. Additionally, animal rights organization Direct Action Everywhere (DxE) has accused Perdue of using a strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) to suppress free speech and obscure the public's understanding of its animal cruelty practices[40]. In response, Perdue's Chief Human Resources Officer, Julie Katigan, stated that while the company welcomes open discussion on animal welfare, it strongly opposes the extreme tactics employed by DxE[41]. Furthermore, Perdue's Chief Animal Care Officer, Mike Levengood, emphasized that the safety of their associates and the welfare of animals are top priorities for the company[42].

## Environmental Issues

Perdue has encountered several environmental challenges, including penalties for environmental violations. The company faced a $12 million settlement for air pollution in Maryland, highlighting ongoing regulatory difficulties[43]. Additionally, Perdue is cooperating with the Maryland Department of Environment to address potential contamination at its soybean processing plant[15]. Perdue is also involved in various pollution reduction initiatives, such as electrifying heavy diesel equipment and funding community terrascaping projects[44].

## Public Perception and Legal Challenges

The company's labeling practices have also been questioned, with critics arguing that Perdue's pastoral labels are misleading and that the USDA has failed to ensure accurate labeling of animal products[18]. Consumer concerns over animal welfare have been increasing, with a significant portion of consumers paying close attention to food labeling claims regarding how animals are raised[18]. These issues collectively pose challenges to Perdue's brand reputation and legal standing in the industry.

# Future Outlook

Perdue Chicken's future outlook appears promising due to its strategic initiatives and adaptability to market demands. Despite challenges such as economic pressures and supply chain disruptions that have led some regional brands to close, Perdue's scale and diversification have enabled it to weather these challenges effectively. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, Perdue increased its e-commerce capabilities and maintained a consistent supply to retailers, demonstrating its agility in crisis management[31]. This adaptability is a critical factor in its ongoing success.
Moreover, Perdue is committed to meeting the growing demand for sustainably sourced chicken that aligns with the "2024" animal welfare criteria. The company plans to offer slower-growing breeds with higher welfare outcomes and reduced stocking densities. Enhanced housing environments are also part of this commitment, featuring brighter lighting, improved litter conditions, and enrichments that promote natural behaviors. Additionally, Perdue is transitioning from electrical to controlled atmosphere stunning and is ensuring compliance through third-party verification[16]. While the Better Chicken Commitment aims to improve animal welfare, it remains to be seen how effectively these commitments will be honored by corporations[21].
Perdue's dedication to innovation, animal welfare, and market responsiveness indicates a positive trajectory for the company. However, it's important to note that despite the company's public commitments to animal welfare, some critics argue that these initiatives might be more about transparency and publicity rather than substantial gains for animal welfare[17]. Nonetheless, Perdue's ability to balance innovation with ethical practices will likely play a significant role in shaping its future success.
