The thorough opinion The Chief Justice wrote for the Court in that case made two things plain: First, the standards of \u00a7 7 require that every corporate acquisition be judged in the light of the contemporary economic context of its industry.", "snippets": [" Further, the merger clearly comported with 'the desirability of retaining 'local control' over industry' that the Court noted in Brown Shoe Co. v.

The share of the market preempted by the present merger was therefore practically identical with the 0.77% market foreclosure accepted as 'quite insubstantial' by the Court in Tampa Electric Co. v. Nashville Coal Co., 365 U.S. 320, 331-333, 81 S.Ct. 623, 630-631, 5 L.Ed.2d 580. The irony of this case is that the Court invokes its sweeping new construction of \u00a7 7 to the detriment of a merger between two relatively successful, local, largely family-owned concerns, each of which had less than 5% of the local market and neither of which had any prior history of growth by acquisition.", "The District Court's finding of fact that there was no increase in market concentration before or after the merger is amply supported by the evidence if concentration is gauged by any measure other than that of a census of the number of competing units. Between 1948 and 1958, the market share of Safeway, the leading grocery chain in Los Angeles, declined from 14% to 8%. The combined market shares of the top two chains declined from 21% to 14% over the same period; for the period 1952-1958, the combined shares of the three, four, and five largest firms also declined.", "United States v.

Von's Grocery Co. \u2014 Finding a violation of section 7 where competing grocery store chains completely merged", "On March 25, 1960, the United States brought this action charging that the acquisition by Von's Grocery Company of its direct competitor Shopping Bag Food Stores, both large retail grocery companies in Los Angeles, California, violated \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act which, as amended in 1950 by the Celler-Kefauver Anti-Merger Act, provides in relevant part:", "Merger of third and sixth largest grocery chains, resulting in a market share of 7.5% where top four had market share of 28.8% (from 1 case) ... Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc. (1977) Cargill, Inc. v. Monfort of Colorado, Inc. (1986) In re Japanese Electronic Products Antitrust Litigation (1983)", "JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court. On March 25, 1960, the United States brought this action charging that the acquisition by Von's Grocery Company of its direct competitor Shopping Bag Food Stores, both large retail grocery companies in Los Angeles, California, violated \u00a7 7 of the Clayton Act which, as amended in 1950 by the Celler-Kefauver Anti-Merger Act, provides in relevant part:", "In the counting-of-heads game played today by the Court, the reduction in the number of single-store operators becomes a yard-stick for automatic disposition of cases under \u00a7 7. I believe that even the most superficial analysis of the record makes plain the fallacy of the Court's syllogism that competition is necessarily reduced when the bare number of competitors has declined. In any meaningful sense, the structure of the Los Angeles grocery market remains unthreatened by concentration.", "In the midst of this steadfast trend toward concentration, Von's and Shopping Bag, two of the most successful and largest companies in the area, jointly owning 66 grocery stores merged to become the second largest chain in Los Angeles. This merger cannot be defended on the ground that one of the companies was about to fail or that the two had to merge to save themselves from destruction by some larger and more powerful competitor. What we have on the contrary *278 is simply the case of two already powerful companies merging in a way which makes them even more powerful than they were before.", "By using these terms in \u00a7 7 which look not merely to the actual present effect of a merger but instead to its effect upon future competition, Congress sought to preserve competition among many small businesses by arresting a trend toward concentration in its incipiency before that trend developed to the point that a market was left in the grip of a few big companies. Thus, where concentration is gaining momentum in a market, we must be alert to carry out Congress' intent to protect competition against ever-increasing concentration through mergers. The facts of this case present exactly the threatening trend toward concentration which Congress wanted to halt. The number of small grocery companies in the Los Angeles retail grocery market had been declining rapidly before the merger and continued to decline rapidly afterwards.", "The Government appealed directly to this Court as authorized by \u00a7 2 of the Expediting Act. The sole question here is whether the District Court properly concluded on the facts before it that the Government had failed to prove a violation of \u00a7 7. The record shows the following facts relevant to our decision. The market involved here is the retail grocery market in the Los Angeles area. In 1958 Von's retail sales ranked third in the area and Shopping Bag's ranked sixth. In 1960 their sales together were 7.5% of the total two and one-half billion dollars of retail groceries sold in the Los Angeles market each year. For many years before the merger both companies had enjoyed great success as rapidly growing companies.", "On March 28, 1960, three days later, the District Court refused to grant the Government's motion for a temporary restraining order and immediately Von's took over all of Shopping Bag's capital stock and assets including 36 grocery stores in the Los Angeles area."], "title": "United States v.
